The Spanish hotel real estate market faces the first quarter of 2026 in a context of operational stability and investor confidence, backed by the resilience of key sector metrics and the strength of cross-border demand. According to multiple reports and statistics from the hotel sector during 2025, main operational variables show positive indicators, with moderate growth in Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), Average Daily Rate (ADR), and occupancy, reflecting consolidation after several years of high activity.

Throughout 2025, the Spanish hotel sector maintained elevated activity levels in terms of revenue and occupancy. In the first half of 2025, RevPAR grew by approximately 6.9% compared to the same period in 2024, while ADR recorded an increase of nearly 6.5%, with stable occupancy rates averaging around 73% nationwide.

The most recently published data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) confirms that hotel metrics continue to show growth and resilience so far this year. In September 2025, the average ADR was €131.4, an increase of about 5% compared to September 2024, and RevPAR reached €102.5, a year-on-year increase of more than 6%.

International Demand and Air Connectivity  
International demand remains a core pillar for the Spanish hotel industry. Although exact projections for the spring of 2026 have not yet been released by official bodies, industry sources indicate that booking trends and arrivals from key source markets remain solid. Growth is expected from countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States for 2026, pointing to a sustainable demand base for the seasonal period.

This support from international demand has allowed the Spanish hotel sector to maintain a balance between rates and occupancy without experiencing significant setbacks compared to the inflationary pressure affecting other areas of commercial real estate.

Investment and Outlook for Hotel Assets  
In the investment realm, hotel assets maintain a prominent position within the Spanish real estate market. According to Colliers data, hotel investment volume in Spain reached €2.8 billion in the first three quarters of 2025, a significant increase over the previous year, consolidating the sector as one of the primary targets for real estate capital.

This dynamism responds both to the demand from operators for well-located assets and the growing presence of domestic investors, who represented approximately 61% of the transacted volume through September 2025, with the remainder originating from diversified international capital.

The most attractive destinations for investors include both leisure and urban markets, with the Canary Islands, Barcelona, Madrid, and the Balearic Islands concentrating much of the transactional interest, both in established 4 and 5-star categories and in products with strategic repositioning potential.

Operational Conditions and Structural Challenges  
While performance metrics indicate stability, the Spanish hotel sector faces structural challenges. These include:  
Pressure on operating costs, including labor and energy, which may strain margins if rates do not compensate for expenditure increases.  
Saturation in some mature tourist destinations, where competition and infrastructure management remain priorities.

These factors are part of the risk analysis that many consulting firms and asset managers are incorporating into their models for 2026, although they have not been translated into official predictions published by sectoral or statistical bodies as of the end of 2025.

Segment Trends and Destinations  
In recent years, Spain has consolidated its position as one of Europe's most relevant hotel destinations in terms of performance and international visitor volume. In 2024, RevPAR reached historic record levels, showing significant year-on-year growth compared to the pre-pandemic period, evidencing the structural strength of the Spanish hotel sector.

Geographic diversification of tourism and stable international demand also support the attractiveness of premium and luxury segments in both urban and resort locations. Although specific projected occupancy data for the spring of 2026 has not been published in official reports, the recent operational trajectory and expectations for air connectivity sustain a vision of moderate growth and relative stability for that period.

Altogether, these fundamentals indicate that the Spanish hotel industry enters 2026 with activity levels and operational indicators corroborated by the latest available figures, providing confidence to asset holders and potential investors regarding the sector's ability to absorb economic cycles and respond to international traveler demand.
