The existence of residential lease agreements signed before 1985—commonly referred to as “old-rent” contracts—continues to generate very specific legal effects in the Spanish housing market. Although their current volume is limited and no public registry exists to quantify them, these contracts remain subject to the mandatory renewal regime established by the 1964 Urban Leases Act and partially preserved under the Third Transitional Provision of Law 29/1994.
An Exceptional but Still Active Mandatory Renewal Regime
Contracts governed by pre-1985 legislation maintain mandatory renewal in favor of the tenant until their death, with the possibility of a single subrogation to certain family members, provided they meet the requirements and deadlines set by the transitional provisions. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld this interpretation, precisely delimiting valid cases for subrogation.
This framework explains why some rental agreements continue to exist at levels significantly below current market rates. However, the legislation does not allow new unlimited renewals, and any transfer must strictly comply with the provisions of DT3 of the 1994 Urban Leases Act.
Renovation, Rehabilitation, and the Right to Rehousing
In cases of necessary works or comprehensive rehabilitation, the law provides specific instruments. Landlords may request contract termination if certain statutory causes arise—such as proven structural ruin or the need to perform works incompatible with tenant occupancy—always through judicial proceedings. Tenants retain rights to temporary rehousing or return if the intervention is carried out according to the legal provisions.
These mechanisms are clearly regulated and constitute the main means of balancing tenant protection with the owner’s duty to preserve the property.
A Stable Framework with Very Limited Market Impact
The coexistence of old contracts and the current leasing regime now has a limited effect on the overall housing stock, although it remains legally relevant due to the complexity of the rules and litigation related to subrogations and property maintenance.
The absence of public data on their exact number prevents reliable estimates. What is clear is that this is an exceptional, tightly defined regime in gradual natural extinction.
