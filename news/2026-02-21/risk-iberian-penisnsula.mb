The Risk of Treating the Iberian Peninsula as a Perpetual Growth Story
Across Spain and Portugal, underwriting models frequently rely on historical averages for vacancy rates, rental growth, and exit yields drawn from expansionary years. Capital appreciation assumptions often mirror the strong performance observed during periods of abundant liquidity and compressed yields.

However, the Iberian Peninsula is not immune to cycles. Spain and Portugal remain:

Highly exposed to broader European economic performance

Dependent on foreign capital inflows

Sensitive to tourism flows

Influenced by ECB monetary policy

Subject to regulatory shifts at both national and municipal levels

Yet much of the risk analysis presented appears narrowly focused on asset-level improvements, location quality, refurbishment, repositioning, while implicitly assuming macro stability.

Markets are neither static nor perfectly efficient. In cyclical regions such as the Iberian Peninsula, extrapolating past averages into the future without systemic stress testing is not prudence; it is overconfidence.

Beta Without Full Transparency
Many Iberian real estate funds emphasize their correlation to a growing market environment. During years of yield compression and rising valuations across Spain and Portugal, beta has appeared favorable. However, beta during expansion tells only half the story.

Rarely do we see equal emphasis placed on:

Standard deviation of returns

Downside sensitivity to yield expansion

Interest coverage resilience under stress

Refinancing exposure within the next 24–36 months

Liquidity risk in secondary markets across the Peninsula

In a rising cycle, beta is presented as validation. In a tightening cycle, that same exposure can amplify volatility.

Balance sheet quality is equally critical. The Iberian Peninsula has historically attracted capital partly because of yield spreads over core European markets. But when leverage is layered onto that spread in a higher-rate environment, even modest yield expansion can materially erode equity value.

Leverage is no longer a neutral tool. In today’s context across Spain and Portugal, it is a structural risk multiplier.

Free Cash Flow Over Narrative
Institutional investors do not allocate capital based on IRR projections alone. They allocate based on resilient, stress-tested free cash flow.

Across the Iberian Peninsula, several sectors, hospitality, residential, logistics, have benefited from strong cyclical tailwinds. But prudent underwriting must ask:

What is the free cash flow profile under slower GDP growth in Spain and Portugal?

What happens if tourism weakens across the Peninsula?

How do regulatory changes, rent controls, taxation, zoning adjustments, affect projected cash flows?

What is the impact of sustained higher financing costs?

Sustained double-digit returns are achievable only through a combination of operational transformation, development exposure, or leverage. Each of these drivers carries measurable downside risk. Presenting such returns as structurally stable across Spain and Portugal risks misaligning expectations with reality.

Structural Strengths — and Structural Vulnerabilities
The Iberian Peninsula offers compelling long-term fundamentals:

Urban regeneration in major metropolitan areas

Logistics growth driven by supply chain realignment

Energy transition and ESG-driven repositioning

Demographic and lifestyle migration trends

But these opportunities coexist with structural vulnerabilities:

Smaller domestic capital markets relative to core Europe

Sensitivity to external demand

Political and regulatory variability

Liquidity constraints outside prime assets

Treating Spain and Portugal as a homogeneous perpetual growth story oversimplifies a region that remains cyclical and capital-flow dependent.

A Responsibility to the Market
As managers, our role is not to compete in optimism. It is to protect principal across cycles.

The Iberian Peninsula does not need inflated return narratives to remain attractive. Spain and Portugal offer real opportunity when approached with:

Conservative leverage structures

Full volatility disclosure

Clear articulation of systemic risk exposure

Scenario-based stress testing

Valuations grounded in durable free cash flow

If we aspire for the Iberian real estate market to consolidate its position within global institutional portfolios, analytical rigor must match capital ambition.

Double-digit returns may occur in specific strategies within Spain and Portugal. But presenting them as a baseline expectation across the Iberian Peninsula in the current environment risks not only individual portfolios, but the long-term credibility of the region itself.
