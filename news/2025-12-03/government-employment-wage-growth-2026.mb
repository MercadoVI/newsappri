The Spanish Government has emphasized in recent statements that improvements in employment and wage growth will remain central to the economy in 2026. These variables align with projections from the Bank of Spain and the European Commission, which anticipate sustained employment growth and a gradual reduction in the unemployment rate over the coming year. At the same time, financial markets are pricing in potential interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank throughout 2026, following the stabilization of the 12-month Euribor at around 2.2% at the end of November.
Expected wage increases are also supported by already approved official measures, including the agreed raise for public-sector employees, which sets an increase of 2.5% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. The combination of greater job stability and higher disposable income provides structural support for domestic demand, with direct implications for household consumption and residential investment.
Housing demand and access to financing
 This scenario helps reinforce the creditworthiness of potential homebuyers. The stabilization of the Euribor after the 2023–2024 rate hikes reduces financial pressure on households and improves debt ratios, facilitating mortgage access for individuals with stable incomes.
In the residential sector, market analysts indicate that the formation of new households and increased job stability could support demand for primary residences in 2026. The new-build segment continues to be constrained by limited supply, affected by scarce developable land and cost pressures, maintaining a price premium for new construction projects.
Rental tension and investor interest
 The rental market remains structurally tight in major metropolitan areas, driven by demographic dynamics and the difficulty some households face in accessing homeownership despite wage growth. This environment sustains investor interest in rental residential assets, particularly in Build-to-Rent models.
Institutional investment flows continue to concentrate in areas with strong employment creation and solvent demand—such as Madrid, Barcelona, Málaga, and Valencia—which continue to attract capital seeking stable returns in a more predictable macroeconomic context than in previous years.
