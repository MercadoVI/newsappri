Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) is increasingly capturing the attention of international real estate investors. Throughout 2025, the region's six primary markets—Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Hungary—experienced a notable rebound in real estate investment, consolidating the area as a key destination for both local and international capital.

Record Growth in 2025  
According to Colliers' "CEE Investment Scene Q1–Q3 2025" report, the total volume of real estate investment in these markets exceeded €7 billion in the first nine months, a 38% increase compared to 2024—the highest figure since 2022.

While growth remains moderate in many traditional Western European markets and interest rates keep investors cautious, CEE has stood out due to its combination of competitive entry costs, moderate inflation, and relative macroeconomic stability—factors that increase its appeal for those seeking geographic diversification and higher returns.

Poland and the Czech Republic: Capital Epicenters  
70% of the investment in the region was concentrated in Poland and the Czech Republic. Poland maintains its position as the largest market by absolute volume, while the Czech Republic stands out for its growth rate, particularly in the office, industrial, and hospitality sectors.

This leadership reflects the relative competitiveness of CEE: higher yields than in Western Europe, less saturation of "core" assets, and economic growth above the regional average, allowing investors to structure positions with more balanced risk-return profiles.

Trends by Asset Segment  
The rebound is not uniform; each segment shows distinct behaviors:

Logistics: Remains the star performer, driven by e-commerce and the need for last-mile infrastructure.

Offices: Demand in central locations has intensified, especially in capitals where quality supply is scarce.

Retail: Showing signs of recovery in certain countries, backed by the modernization of shopping centers and adaptation to omnichannel consumer experiences.

Structural Factors Sustaining Investment  
The growth of investment in CEE is supported by several key elements:

Relative Macroeconomic Stability: Several countries maintain solid growth and stable employment levels.

Attractive Yields and Lower Saturation: Assets that combine competitive yields with appreciation potential.

Growing Local Capital: Facilitates transactions and provides additional liquidity, complementing the entry of foreign funds.

Potential Opportunities for Real Estate Crowdfunding  
While the reports analyzed do not include specific data on crowdfunding, the increase in investment activity in CEE suggests interesting opportunities for digital platforms looking to geographically diversify their projects. Assets in logistics, renovated offices, and adapted retail could offer attractive structural returns, provided there is rigorous risk analysis and comparable metrics.

The presence of foreign and institutional capital also points to an environment with greater liquidity and transparency than in previous cycles, which could favor the structuring of digital investment opportunities.

Realty Investor: A Platform Under Development  
Realty Investor is creating a digital ecosystem that will centralize real estate crowdfunding and crowdlending opportunities in a single environment. Investors will be able to discover, compare, and invest in projects from a single application, featuring verified information and homogeneous metrics.
