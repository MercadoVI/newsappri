The latest macroeconomic snapshot of the eurozone confirms an economy that is expanding, but at a very subdued pace. According to preliminary estimates from Eurostat, the eurozone’s GDP grew by 0.2 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter of 2025, while the EU as a whole advanced by 0.3 per cent. On an annual basis, output increased by roughly 1.4 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively—figures that reinforce the narrative of moderate, yet positive, economic momentum.

This performance aligns with the European Central Bank’s own diagnosis: the bloc continues to avoid recession but remains trapped in a cycle of structurally weak growth, constrained by soft global trade and a lacklustre industrial sector in core economies such as Germany.

Against this backdrop, Spain stands out as a clear outlier. National accounts data from the INE show that Spanish GDP expanded by 0.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter—three times the pace of the eurozone—driven primarily by robust domestic demand. The European Commission projects Spain to grow close to 2.9 per cent in 2025, markedly above the more moderate outlook for the monetary union.

For the real estate sector, this divergence matters through several channels: household income, business confidence and employment intensity. A eurozone growing at just 0.2 per cent quarterly limits the capacity for rental growth in offices and logistics, especially in markets already weakened by industrial stagnation. Conversely, Spain’s stronger economic base supports both residential demand and commercial activity even in an environment where financing conditions remain tight.

This difference has been increasingly visible in investor behaviour. In recent years, Spain—and southern Europe more broadly—has attracted a rising share of global capital, drawn by the combination of economic expansion, resilient tourism and favourable demographic trends. While none of these factors guarantee returns, they help explain why cross-border capital has favoured Spanish hotels, rental housing, logistics assets and retail parks over other European alternatives.

Monetary policy adds another layer to the equation. The ECB has kept rates at restrictive levels, but its economic bulletin acknowledges the slowdown across the eurozone. As inflation moderates and growth remains subdued, markets are increasingly pricing in early rate cuts in 2026—an adjustment that would have immediate consequences for developer financing, mortgage activity and asset valuations.

For real estate investors, a eurozone characterised by “low but positive” growth is a nuanced environment: stable enough to avoid sharp corrections in occupancy or rents, yet insufficient to justify widespread yield compression. In this setting, asset selection and location quality become more decisive, particularly while interest rates remain above the levels of the past decade.

In Spain, the combination of stronger growth, a favourable labour market and a robust services sector continues to support demand across several submarkets: rental housing in major metropolitan areas, logistics corridors with persistent e-commerce traffic, and hotel assets benefiting from record tourist inflows. While regulatory and affordability challenges remain, the macroeconomic backdrop positions Spain more favourably than many of its European peers.

Ultimately, the contrast between a subdued eurozone and a comparatively dynamic Spain is reshaping the continent’s real estate map. For investors with a pan-European mandate, the divergence reinforces the case for overweighting markets where GDP and employment fundamentals offer deeper support—an increasingly relevant consideration as the cycle enters a new phase.
