The debate over limiting speculative home purchases reopens Spain’s legal discussion on property rights

Efforts by Spanish authorities to curb the sharp rise in housing prices have reignited a complex debate: can speculative home purchases be limited without infringing on constitutional property rights? The question, which lies at the intersection of housing policy and constitutional law, has returned to the forefront following recent statements by Sílvia Paneque, Catalonia’s Minister for Territory, who has proposed restrictions on housing acquisitions in highly stressed markets.

Paneque stated in late October — as reported by El Periódico de Catalunya — that her department is studying measures to “prioritise actual residential use over speculative or short-term investment purchases.” While she did not specify the legal tools under consideration, she suggested the potential use of fiscal disincentives or occupancy requirements in certain urban areas, particularly in Barcelona and its metropolitan region.

Such proposals, however, face significant constitutional limits. Article 33 of the Spanish Constitution recognises the right to private property and inheritance, stating that “the social function of these rights shall delimit their content.” This allows governments to regulate property use — for instance, through rent controls or maintenance obligations — but not to directly restrict transactions. As urban planning lawyer José Ramón Morales explained in ABC (3 November 2025), “banning property acquisitions based on the buyer’s purpose would likely be unconstitutional, as it infringes on freedom of enterprise and the right of disposal.”

The underlying issue is a housing market under persistent pressure. According to the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE), the House Price Index rose 12.7% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2025, its fastest pace since 2007. Meanwhile, home sales fell 3.4% year-on-year in August, reflecting households’ reduced purchasing power amid still-high prices. This imbalance between supply and income is intensifying public demand for government intervention, particularly in major cities.

Spain’s Housing Law, approved in 2023, already introduced rent caps in “stressed” zones but did not include restrictions on home purchases. Implementing such measures would require a far-reaching legal reform and would almost certainly face challenges before the Constitutional Court. The Spanish Association of Developers and Builders (APCE) and the General Council of Notaries have both warned that direct restrictions on acquisition could “freeze investment and slow new housing production, further aggravating the structural shortage.”

The OECD and the European Commission have repeatedly advised Spain to focus on increasing housing supply and cutting red tape, rather than constraining demand. The Ministry of Housing estimates that between 250,000 and 300,000 new homes per year are needed to balance the market — nearly triple the 110,000 built in 2024.

Meanwhile, real estate crowdfunding has emerged as an alternative channel for investment, allowing retail investors to participate in development or rental projects without direct property ownership. According to data from the Spanish Crowdfunding and Alternative Finance Association (AEFP) and platforms such as Urbanitae, StockCrowd IN, and Civislend, the market reached over €250 million in 2024, with steady growth expected through 2025. For investors, this model offers exposure to the housing sector with lower barriers to entry and without being affected by potential acquisition restrictions.

Ultimately, the debate over speculative buying transcends housing policy — it touches on the core balance between economic freedom and the social function of property. In Spain, where housing is both a financial asset and a social necessity, any attempt to regulate acquisition will require exceptional legal precision. The challenge lies in designing policies that expand access and reduce inequality without undermining legal certainty or discouraging the investment needed to expand supply.
