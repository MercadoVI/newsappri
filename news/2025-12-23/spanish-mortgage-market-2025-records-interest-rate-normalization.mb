The Spanish financial ecosystem closed the tenth month of 2025 with signs of structural solidity that defy the slowdown projections seen at the beginning of the year. According to definitive data from the Mortgage Statistics report by the INE (National Statistics Institute), the residential market has not only recovered its vigor following the monetary tightening cycle but has also established a new benchmark for the coming decade. The analysis of capital flows, interest rates, and territorial distribution reveals a scenario of positive normalization, where access to credit has once again become the engine of national real estate activity.

### I. Demand Vigor: October at a 16-Year High

The most relevant data point from the monthly report is the volume of activity recorded in the property registries. In October 2025, the number of mortgages constituted on dwellings reached **52,198 operations**, according to the Mortgage Statistics report by the INE. This figure represents a **0.6% year-on-year increase** and, more significantly for capital analysts, reflects a **monthly growth of 13.2%** compared to September 2025.

From a historical perspective, the market has managed to break a **16-year record for the month of October**, placing transaction volumes at levels not seen since September 2010. The monthly series confirms that mortgages on dwellings have now recorded **16 consecutive months of year-on-year increases**, consolidating a bullish trend that appears resilient to external macroeconomic volatility.

### II. Rate Engineering: Breaking the 3% Barrier

The undeniable catalyst for this record volume has been the downward trend in the cost of money. The Mortgage Statistics report by the INE details that the **average interest rate** at the beginning of mortgage operations for dwellings stood at **2.81% in October 2025**, the lowest level since January 2023. This marks **nine consecutive months below the 3% threshold**, a key psychological level for both households and lenders.

From a structural perspective, **61.3% of new mortgages were signed at a fixed rate**, with an average interest rate of **2.82%** and an average repayment term of **26 years**. The remaining **38.7%** opted for variable-rate mortgages, with a slightly lower initial average interest of **2.79%**.

This preference for fixed-rate stability—even in a declining rate environment—signals a clear borrower bias toward long-term predictability. Additionally, **75.7% of mortgage modifications** during the period were linked to interest rate changes, underscoring proactive balance-sheet management by Spanish households.

### III. Capital Dynamics: Higher Indebtedness and Investment Flows

While the number of operations grew modestly on an annual basis, the **capital mobilized expanded at a much faster pace**. The **average mortgage amount** reached **€167,080**, a **10.4% increase** compared to October 2024, according to the Mortgage Statistics report by the INE.

Total capital lent for home purchases amounted to **€8.721 billion**, reflecting an **11.0% year-on-year increase**. When extending the scope to all property types (including rustic and other urban assets), total mobilized capital rose to **€12.253 billion**, an **8% annual increase**. These figures point to sustained upward pressure on asset valuations and increasing financial depth in residential transactions.

### IV. Territorial Radiography: The New Growth Map

Geographically, mortgage growth in Spain shows increasing fragmentation. According to the Mortgage Statistics report by the INE, **Asturias** emerged as the strongest performer, with a **47.8% year-on-year increase** in the number of signed mortgages. Regions such as **Castilla-La Mancha (+27%)** and **Cantabria (+25.4%)** followed closely, benefiting from demand displacement away from overheated metropolitan areas.

In contrast, traditional prime markets showed early signs of saturation. The **Community of Madrid** registered a **5.9% year-on-year decline** in mortgage activity, while **Aragón (-10.7%)** and **Castilla y León (-7.9%)** also posted negative figures. Despite this, **Andalusia, Catalonia, and the Valencian Community** continue to account for the largest absolute volumes of mortgage capital, preserving their role as systemic liquidity hubs.

### V. 2025 Year-to-Date: An Exercise in Accumulated Expansion

Looking at the January–October period, the Mortgage Statistics report by the INE confirms that **2025 is shaping up as a year of exceptional expansion**. The number of mortgages for home purchases increased by **18.4% year-on-year**, while **accumulated capital lent surged by 33.4%**. Over the same period, the **average loan amount rose by 12.7%**, reinforcing the trend toward financing higher-value residential assets.

These dynamics suggest that Spain’s banking system is increasingly allocating credit toward assets with stronger collateral quality and higher solvency profiles.

### VI. Strategic Conclusion

The October 2025 mortgage data certifies a clear **paradigm shift**. Interest rate normalization around **2.8%** has unlocked latent demand, driving transaction volumes to multi-year highs. The dominance of fixed-rate mortgages and the steady increase in average loan sizes point to a real estate market supported by solid household balance sheets and a competitive, well-capitalized banking sector.

For investors, the opportunity lies in identifying **emerging regional growth nodes** such as Asturias or Cantabria, while closely monitoring absorption dynamics in saturated prime markets like Madrid, where affordability constraints are beginning to cap financing growth.
