Speed has once again taken center stage in the real estate crowdfunding sector. Today, **Tuesday, December 23rd**, **Urbanitae** set a new benchmark by closing the **Residencial Intur Panorámico Project** in a matter of seconds. The operation, aimed at raising **€1,285,000** to finance the development of a **106-unit residential tower in Huelva**, completed its funding phase in **just one minute**, highlighting the extraordinary appetite for well-structured debt opportunities.

### The Figures of a Historic Closing

The response from the investor community was immediate and overwhelming. Final figures from the round reflect one of the fastest capital mobilizations recorded on the platform:

- **Closing time:** 1 minute  
- **Total capital raised:** €1,285,000  
- **Participating investors:** 754  
- **Average ticket:** €1,704  
- **Funding velocity:** €1,285,000 per minute  

This milestone is particularly significant given the **€10,000 per-investor cap**, a mechanism designed to ensure broad participation. Even with this restriction in place, the platform processed capital at a rate of approximately **€21,416 per second**, exhausting availability before many investors were able to complete the investment process.

### Technical Analysis: Why Such Massive Interest?

The rapid closure of **Residencial Intur Panorámico** is the result of a carefully balanced risk structure, advanced project execution, and a location benefiting from strong structural tailwinds.

#### 1. Loan Security and Investor Protections

The project was structured as a **fixed-rate loan with a 10.0% annual TIN**. A key differentiating factor was the **minimum return protection**, which guarantees investors the equivalent of **10 months of interest**, even in the event of early repayment before the estimated **12-month maturity**.

Additionally, the structure includes the **option to convert debt into equity in the event of default**, providing a level of downside protection significantly above the market average for comparable debt instruments.

#### 2. Commercial and Technical Progress

Unlike many projects launched at early stages, **Residencial Intur Panorámico** entered the platform with a **70% commercial progress rate**, with **75 out of 106 units already sold**. This compares favorably with other recent operations such as the Ronquillo Project (44%) or Homing Pozuelo (61%).

From a technical standpoint, the project already holds a **granted building license**, a **signed developer bank loan**, and has surpassed the **foundation phase**, reaching approximately **10% construction progress**. These milestones substantially reduce execution risk at the most critical stages of development.

#### 3. Location Advantage: Huelva and the Ensanche Sur

The project’s location in **Ensanche Sur (Huelva)** has been another decisive factor. The area is undergoing a significant transformation driven by the **Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley**, an industrial initiative expected to attract **over €3 billion in investment**.

This reindustrialization process is generating strong demand for modern housing in a city facing a **structural shortage of new residential supply**, creating favorable conditions for rapid absorption of the remaining units in the development.

### The Role of the Developer: Grupo Intur

Investor confidence was further reinforced by the track record of **Grupo Intur**. With **more than 150 homes delivered** and a current management portfolio of **206 units**, the developer has demonstrated the operational capacity required to execute projects of this scale.

Their decision to finance this **€1.28 million debt tranche** through Urbanitae highlights the growing role of crowdfunding platforms as efficient complements to traditional banking for final-stage financing needs.
