The Rise of ‘Deep Tech’: How Industrial Innovation Is Redefining Spanish Real Estate

This article is for informational purposes only and does not, under any circumstances, constitute investment advice or a recommendation.

Spain is undergoing a quiet transformation at the core of its productive fabric. The so-called deep tech economy — that based on science, advanced engineering, and frontier technology — is growing at a steady pace, and with it, a new demand for highly specialized physical spaces. This transformation, combining innovation, knowledge, and capital, is beginning to reshape the national real estate market.

According to data published by Cinco Días (El País) on October 27, 2025, Catalonia and Madrid lead the creation of deep tech spin-offs in Spain, with annual growth of 3.6%. These are companies born in universities or research centers that develop high-impact technologies in fields such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, advanced materials, or sustainable energy. Unlike traditional startups, they require specific facilities — laboratories, light production spaces, testing zones, or innovation hubs — which are not typically found in standard real estate offerings.

### A New Type of Asset: Hybrid Scientific and Industrial Spaces

The rise of these companies is driving demand for a new kind of hybrid real estate asset — part office, part industrial building, and part laboratory. In Catalonia, Parc de l’Alba in Cerdanyola del Vallès — home to the ALBA Synchrotron — has become the epicenter of the scientific ecosystem, attracting companies in biomedicine, photonics, and smart materials. In Madrid, the Science Park of the Autonomous University and the Digital District of Alcobendas replicate this model, combining research, entrepreneurship, and adaptable workspaces.

According to Savills Spain, industrial space leasing for technological and R&D uses increased by more than 10% in 2024, especially along the Barcelona and Madrid corridors. At the same time, investment in technology parks and innovation centers continues to grow steadily, driven by specialized funds and family offices seeking to diversify their portfolios toward assets with a moderate risk profile and stable long-term returns.

### Innovation and Territory: A New Real Estate Value Axis

The expansion of the deep tech sector is creating a multiplier effect across territories. Municipalities that succeed in attracting these companies experience growth in qualified employment, increased local tax revenues, and positive impacts on housing and service demand. In fact, Spain’s Ministry of Science and Innovation estimates that each euro invested in scientific infrastructure generates up to 2.3 additional euros in surrounding economic activity.

In this context, real estate ceases to be merely a physical support and becomes an enabler of innovation. The proximity between research centers, universities, and technology companies fosters the creation of advanced industrial micro-districts — such as 22@ in Barcelona or Madrid Content City in Tres Cantos — that combine productive, residential, and educational uses.

The Role of Private Capital and Alternative Financing

Interest in technological assets is not limited to large institutional investors. Collective financing and real estate crowdfunding platforms are beginning to channel private savings toward territorial innovation projects, allowing small investors to participate in the development of industrial and technological spaces.

Digitization and European regulation under Regulation (EU) 2020/1503, which harmonizes investment crowdfunding, have enabled these projects to be financed more transparently, with standardized information and supervision by Spain’s CNMV (National Securities Market Commission). This opens the door for individual investors to access segments traditionally reserved for specialized funds — such as science parks, research facilities, or buildings dedicated to tech incubators.

### From the Digital Economy to the Tangible Economy

The rise of deep tech is bringing physical industry back into focus in a country that for decades built its growth on services. Spain is witnessing how the new digital economy — based on data, software, and talent — requires tangible spaces, with complex infrastructure and industrial connectivity. This shift is changing the nature of real estate investment, orienting it toward the production of knowledge and technology, not merely housing or tourism.

For investors, this trend represents both an opportunity and a challenge. Returns are more stable than in traditional residential real estate, but asset maturity periods are longer and require technical understanding. However, the chance to participate in long-term value creation — in sectors such as biotechnology, robotics, or clean energy — offers a strategic dimension that goes beyond immediate financial performance.

### A New Frontier for the Informed Investor

The intersection between scientific innovation and the real estate market demands a deeper understanding of the economic and technological context. The ability to identify solid projects, locations with established scientific ecosystems, and experienced operators will be key to capturing value.

In this environment, comparative information, transparency, and technology applied to investment are essential tools. Platforms that centralize opportunities, standardize metrics, and offer independent analysis will enable investors to navigate this new market with greater clarity and control. The connection between private capital and industrial innovation will be one of the driving forces behind Spanish real estate growth in the coming decade.
