The Spanish Real Estate Market Faces Dual Pressure: Supply Shortage and International Demand Surge

This article is for informational purposes only and does not, under any circumstances, constitute investment advice or a recommendation.

The Spanish real estate market is experiencing steady growth, but also structural imbalances. The supply of new housing remains well below demographic needs, while demand — both domestic and international — continues to be strong. This combination is creating price tensions that extend beyond the major capitals and pose challenges for affordability and urban planning.

According to the Housing Price Index published by Spain’s National Statistics Institute (INE), prices rose 12.7% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2025 — the highest rate since 2007. Second-hand housing increased by 12.8%, while new housing rose by 12.1%, driven by land scarcity and rising construction costs. In parallel, the Bank of Spain estimates a structural deficit of between 600,000 and 700,000 homes, leaving annual production — around 110,000 units — far below what is needed to balance demand.

### Limited Supply, Rising Costs

The number of completed homes grew by only 1.1% in 2024, and the shortage of ready-to-build land remains one of the main bottlenecks. Added to this are inflation in materials and higher financing costs, both of which have slowed the start of new developments.

Developers also highlight the difficulty of obtaining urban planning permits in major cities. In Madrid, for example, the average processing time exceeds 18 months, causing significant delays and further limiting supply. The result is a market where new housing is concentrated in the hands of large operators, and land prices are rising faster than those of the final product.

### The Return of the Foreign Buyer

While supply stagnates, international demand continues to strengthen. According to the Spanish Land Registry Association (Colegio de Registradores), 15% of all home purchases in Spain during the first half of 2025 were made by foreign buyers. The top purchasing countries are the United Kingdom, Germany, Morocco, Italy, and France.

The most active regions are Alicante, Málaga, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and the Balearic Islands, where more than one-third of transactions are made by non-residents. This trend reflects the strength of residential tourism and Spain’s appeal as a destination for retirement or remote work. However, it also exacerbates pressure on local supply, especially in island and coastal markets with limited room for urban expansion.

The rise of foreign buyers also has an indirect effect on the national market: it raises profitability expectations, drives up land prices, and pushes part of domestic demand toward rentals or more affordable secondary cities such as Valencia, Murcia, or Granada.

### The Rental Market as a Safety Valve

The rental market is also under pressure. According to data from Idealista, the supply of rental housing fell by 20% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2025, while rental prices rose by 10.2%, reaching record highs in cities like Madrid and Barcelona.

The growth of mid-term rentals and the conversion of tourist apartments into medium-stay housing are reducing the supply available for long-term residents. At the same time, the build-to-rent sector (homes built specifically for rent) continues to gain prominence: according to CBRE Spain, the Living segment — which includes rentals, student housing, and co-living — accounted for 23% of total real estate investment in the first half of 2025.

For many institutional investors, rental housing has become a more predictable alternative to the buy-sell cycle. However, the shortage of land and regulatory uncertainty still limit the pace of new development.

### Digitalization and Access: The New Path for Investors

In this context, digital investment platforms are playing an increasingly important role. Real estate crowdfunding and crowdlending make it possible to finance residential or rental projects through small contributions, providing standardized information on risk, profitability, and developers.

These models — regulated by Spain’s CNMV under Law 18/2022 and the European Regulation 2020/1503 — have democratized access to real estate investment, allowing individuals to participate in the development of real projects, from urban refurbishments to sustainable developments in expanding areas. For the sector, they represent an additional source of capital at a time of high demand and limited bank financing.

Transparency and accessibility are key factors for the new generation of investors. Understanding the type of asset, its location, and the investment horizon is essential to balance risk and return in an increasingly competitive and fragmented market.

### A Delicate Balance — But Full of Opportunity

Spain remains one of Europe’s most solid real estate destinations, with a stable economy, a diversified financial market, and growing international demand. However, structural supply shortages and rising prices require rethinking investment strategies, prioritizing projects with added value and long-term sustainability.

The challenge in the coming years will be to expand the housing stock without compromising territorial balance or affordability. Land-use policies, the promotion of rehabilitation, and public-private collaboration will be decisive. At the same time, digitalization and collective investment are opening the door to a new generation of investors seeking clarity, efficiency, and control.
