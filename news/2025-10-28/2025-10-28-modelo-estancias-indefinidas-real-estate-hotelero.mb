The Indefinite Stay Model: The New Frontier of Hotel Real Estate in Spain

This article is for informational purposes only and does not, under any circumstances, constitute investment advice or a recommendation.

Spain’s hotel sector is undergoing a quiet yet profound transformation. After a decade marked by post-pandemic recovery and the consolidation of international tourism, a new format has emerged that challenges the traditional short-stay model: indefinite stays. This concept blends accommodation, temporary housing, and work flexibility — and it is beginning to redefine the profitability of hotel assets across Spain.

According to Infobae España (October 17, 2025), several hotel entrepreneurs have begun adapting their establishments to this long-stay model. One of them acknowledges that “after 14 days, you stop making money with the traditional hotel model” — a statement that summarizes the current tension between occupancy, costs, and margins. Profitability in many urban hotels, especially in high-turnover destinations, has been squeezed by rising energy prices, labor costs, and competition from short-term rental platforms.

### From Tourist to Temporary Resident

Shifts in traveler behavior have been decisive. The rise of remote work, the boom in digital nomads, and a growing preference for longer stays have blurred the line between tourism and residential use. Cities like Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Málaga are seeing increasing demand for flexible accommodations that integrate living and working services.

According to STR and CBRE Hotels, the average stay in Spanish urban hotels now exceeds 3.2 nights — its highest level in more than a decade. Meanwhile, the apart-hotel and serviced apartment segment — tourist housing with hotel-style management — grew by 9% in 2024 and continues at a similar pace in 2025, driven by business travel and mid-term stays.

This new type of guest seeks stability, connectivity, and complete domestic services. The market’s response has been the creation of hybrid products: buildings combining apartments with equipped kitchens, shared workspaces, and cleaning or dining services under flexible contracts. In essence, it represents a structural realignment of the hotel model — closer to a managed residence than a conventional hotel.

### Spain, the Epicenter of European Hotel Investment

Spain remains highly attractive to international investors. According to the Spain Hotel Investment Report 2025 by CBRE, hotel investment volume in Spain reached €3.2 billion in 2024, up 16% from the previous year. Madrid, Barcelona, Málaga, and the Balearic Islands account for more than 70% of transactions, but capital is beginning to diversify toward emerging destinations such as Valencia, Bilbao, and the Canary Islands.

This interest is explained by the strength of Spanish tourism — which welcomed over 85 million international visitors in 2024, according to the INE — and by the diversification of the hotel offering. Hospitality funds are increasingly prioritizing projects with a flexible residential or extended-stay component, less exposed to seasonality and offering more predictable income streams.

Profitability and Sustainability: A Renewed Equation

The long-stay model offers clear operational advantages: it reduces cleaning and guest turnover costs, stabilizes monthly income, and allows better workforce planning. It also aligns with the sector’s sustainability goals by optimizing resources and minimizing intensive rotation.

Leading consultancies agree that the average gross yield of hotel assets in Spain stands between 6% and 7%, though the extended-stay segment — thanks to its lower volatility — tends to deliver more stable medium-term returns. Savills Hotels notes that this format, still emerging in Spain, represents about 10% of the total inventory and is expected to be one of the main growth drivers in the coming years.

### Opportunities for the Digital Investor

The rise of this type of project attracts not only large funds and institutional operators but also individual investors who, thanks to digitalization, can now participate in their financing through real estate crowdfunding or crowdlending. These platforms, supervised by Spain’s CNMV, enable investment in tourism or residential assets with relatively small amounts, providing standardized information about the developer, financial conditions, and expected performance.

The appeal of this model lies in its transparency and the ability to diversify across different asset types — from converted urban hotels to mixed-use projects combining housing and temporary accommodation. For investors, this opens access to a segment of the hospitality market that was, until recently, reserved for institutions.

### The Line Between Housing and Tourism Is Fading

Spain, traditionally a leader in European tourism, is also becoming a laboratory for real estate innovation. Indefinite stays are a natural response to new lifestyles and the demand for flexibility in an increasingly competitive market. This shift is redefining how urban space is conceived and financed: more adaptable buildings, more flexible contracts, and more diversified profitability.

The trend points to a future where investors will seek projects combining sustainable returns, efficiency, and genuine usability. In that context, clear information, comparability between opportunities, and digitalization will be key tools to understand and participate in the new accommodation economy.
