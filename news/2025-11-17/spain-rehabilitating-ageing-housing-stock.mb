Spain Faces the Challenge of Rehabilitating an Ageing and Vulnerable Housing Stock

This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute, under any circumstances, investment advice or a recommendation.

Spain’s housing debate is often dominated by prices, rents and supply shortages. Yet an equally pressing challenge lies beneath the surface: the physical and energy condition of the country’s residential stock. Spain has around 27 million dwellings, and more than half—approximately 14 million—were built before 1980, when no energy-efficiency standards existed. This structural reality explains why around 23% of Spanish households—more than six million families—live in homes with damp, outdated installations or serious insulation deficiencies, according to data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) and the State Housing Plan, reported by elDiario.es.

The European comparison reinforces the scale of the problem. While roughly 12% of EU households live in homes with severe deficiencies, Spain nearly doubles that figure. The government also acknowledges that around 55% of the entire built stock predates 1980 and that nearly 58% of buildings were constructed before the country’s first basic thermal regulation. The result is higher energy bills, lower comfort and growing vulnerability—especially for households with fewer resources.

This structural weakness collides directly with Europe’s decarbonisation agenda. The new Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EU) 2024/1275 sets out a roadmap for a net-zero building stock by 2050. Member States must reduce average primary energy consumption by at least 16% before 2030 relative to 2020, with deeper cuts required for 2035 and beyond. For Spain, where more than 80% of homes carry an E, F or G energy rating, the scale of the task is especially demanding.

Spain has allocated €5.5 billion from EU Next Generation funds to the national rehabilitation programme under the Recovery Plan, with the objective of achieving around 510,000 renovation actions by mid-2026. These include improvements in energy performance, accessibility and urban regeneration. Execution, however, is lagging: by the end of the first quarter, only 42% of rehabilitation funds had been effectively spent, despite approximately 80% already being transferred to regional governments. Administrative bottlenecks remain a persistent barrier.

Experts from the think tank Alinnea identify three principal obstacles: limited demand despite the obvious need, constrained financial capacity among households—particularly those most vulnerable—and excessively complex access to subsidies. Their report, Proposals to Boost Building Renovation and Decarbonisation, highlights an even broader issue: around 85% of Spanish homes show low energy efficiency, meaning that renovation will increasingly shape market valuations and regulatory compliance.

The cost dimension adds another layer of difficulty. Various technical analyses estimate that significant energy renovation in a typical Spanish dwelling can require between €10,000 and €20,000 in investment—amounts beyond the reach of many communities of neighbours without substantial public support. Some municipalities have attempted to bridge the gap. In Soria, for example, subsidies funded by the Recovery Plan offer up to €25,000 per dwelling, covering as much as 95% of renovation costs depending on the level of energy improvement achieved. However, these examples remain the exception rather than the rule.

For the real estate sector, the transformation of Spain’s ageing housing stock presents both challenges and opportunities. Failure to rehabilitate implies depreciation, higher operating costs and accelerated regulatory risk as EU requirements tighten. In contrast, large-scale renovation programmes create a pipeline for specialised operators in energy retrofits, building-envelope upgrades and comprehensive refurbishment projects. For investors, including those entering the market through real estate crowdfunding, renovation is emerging as a segment linked to long-term structural demand. Yet these projects require rigorous technical evaluation, coordination with public incentives and strong execution capabilities.

Spain thus stands at a crossroads. The country must not only expand its housing supply but also modernise one of Europe’s oldest and least energy-efficient residential stocks. Whether it can accelerate the pace of renovation will shape affordability, investment attractiveness and the ability to meet EU climate targets. Delay will only magnify the effort required and increase the pressure on households, institutions and the wider real estate market.
