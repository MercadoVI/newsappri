Six Million Spanish Households Live in Homes with Serious Deficiencies: The Weak Link in the Real Estate Market

The debate around housing in Spain often focuses on prices, rental tensions or the shortage of public stock. Far less visible—yet equally critical for the economy and the real estate sector—is the physical condition of the country’s residential assets. According to data from the National Statistics Institute (INE), cited in the new State Housing Plan and reported by elDiario.es (15 November 2025), more than six million Spanish families—around 23% of all households—live in homes with damp, deteriorated installations or serious thermal and acoustic insulation problems. The figure is almost double the European average, which stands at roughly 12%.

Spain has approximately 27 million dwellings, and more than half of them—close to 14 million—were built before 1980, when no energy-efficiency standards existed. This ageing structural base has a direct impact on living conditions: greater energy consumption, higher utility bills, and increased vulnerability for lower-income households. The ageing of the housing stock is not only a social challenge but also a growing economic risk, as older, inefficient buildings become less attractive for buyers, tenants and institutional investors seeking long-term resilience.

Energy performance is at the core of the problem. Analyses from the Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (IDAE) and Green Building Council España (GBCe) indicate that more than 80% of Spain’s residential buildings carry an E, F or G energy rating—below minimum efficiency thresholds. At the European level, the new Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) sets a trajectory toward a net-zero building stock by 2050, requiring Member States to cut average energy consumption by at least 16% before 2030 and to reach deeper reductions in the following decade. These targets imply substantial upgrades to one of Europe’s most outdated residential inventories.

Public support mechanisms are in place but progressing slowly. Spain allocated €5.5 billion from EU Next Generation funds to the national housing refurbishment programme under the Recovery Plan. The government’s objective is to complete around 510,000 renovation actions by mid-2026, including energy upgrades, accessibility improvements and urban-regeneration measures. However, implementation remains sluggish: by the end of the first quarter of this year, only 42% of the renovation funds had been executed, despite roughly 80% already being transferred to regional governments. Administrative bottlenecks and limited uptake among households remain major obstacles.

According to experts from the think tank Alinnea, who presented the report Proposals to Boost Building Renovation and Decarbonisation, the barriers are threefold: weak demand despite the scale of need, financial constraints for vulnerable households and excessive administrative complexity. The report notes that around 85% of Spanish homes currently show low energy efficiency and warns of the intensifying economic gap between renovated and non-renovated buildings as EU climate deadlines approach.

This situation creates both risks and opportunities for the real estate sector. For homeowners and communities of neighbours, the lack of refurbishment leads to depreciation, higher running costs and potential regulatory restrictions. For the industry, the structural inefficiency of millions of dwellings represents a substantial pipeline for companies specialising in energy retrofits, building-envelope upgrades and integrated refurbishment services. Yet the viability of many projects depends on simplified procedures, stable incentives and accessible financing frameworks—particularly in middle- and lower-income neighbourhoods.

For investors, including those increasingly active through real estate crowdfunding platforms, the refurbishment market is emerging as a segment with potential long-term relevance. Energy improvements, structural rehabilitation and building-wide upgrades can generate returns through increased asset value, operational savings or improved rental performance. However, these projects involve more technical complexity than traditional developments and require rigorous due-diligence processes, coordination with public aid schemes and strong execution capabilities.

Spain’s residential challenge is therefore twofold: expand housing supply while simultaneously upgrading one of Europe’s oldest and least efficient housing stocks. Whether the country can accelerate its refurbishment pace will shape both affordability and investment attractiveness. The longer interventions are delayed, the steeper the adjustment required to meet EU targets—and the greater the pressure on households and market operators.
