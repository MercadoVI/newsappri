Spain Pulls Ahead of Europe with a Historic Surge in Real Estate Investment

Spain has emerged as one of Europe’s most dynamic real estate markets in 2025, distancing itself from the continent’s sluggish investment environment. According to the latest figures published by Savills and reported by leading economic media, real estate investment in Spain reached €11.8 billion by the end of September, representing a 42% year-on-year increase. Over the same period, Europe registered growth of just 1.5%, with total transactions of around €130 billion.

Data from CBRE offers a similar picture. The firm estimates that investment in Spain rose to €12.9 billion between January and September—up 44% year-on-year—marking the third-highest volume ever recorded, surpassed only by 2018 and 2022. Despite minor methodological differences between sources, both converge on a central conclusion: Spain is experiencing a clear and exceptional upswing in capital flows.

Segment by segment, CBRE’s breakdown reveals where investor interest is concentrating. Residential and “living” assets accounted for more than €3.75 billion, or 29% of total investment. Hotels followed with over €2.6 billion (20%). Retail reached €1.94 billion (15%), while healthcare and alternative assets—such as student housing and senior living—absorbed around €1.9 billion. Office investment exceeded €1.67 billion (13%), and industrial and logistics assets totalled €1.06 billion (8%), a notable 18% increase over the previous year.

Two major corporate transactions provided a significant boost to the quarterly figures: the acquisition of the Livensa student-housing portfolio by Nido, and the purchase of the Vitalia Home senior-care platform by StepStone and Greykite from CVC. These deals illustrate the growing structural weight of alternative living assets in Spain’s investment landscape.

The contrast with the rest of Europe is stark. While the continent is expected to close 2025 with roughly €210 billion in real estate investment—about 7% annual growth—Spain could end the year near the €17 billion mark. The combination of price attractiveness relative to other mature markets, a robust deal pipeline and renewed international appetite for Spanish residential, hotel and logistics assets explains much of this divergence.

For the domestic real estate sector, this influx of capital carries several implications. First, it consolidates Spain as one of Europe’s most attractive destinations for institutional investors, particularly in segments supported by demographic trends and stable demand. Second, it raises the bar for asset management, ESG alignment and transparency—key requirements for global capital. Third, it reinforces the strategic importance of alternative residential formats such as student housing, senior living and build-to-rent, which are increasingly shaping investor allocation decisions.

For smaller investors and participants in real estate crowdfunding, the surge in institutional activity serves as a benchmark rather than a direct competitor. While large transactions operate far above the ticket size of retail investors, they shape valuations, highlight high-demand locations and offer signals about long-term structural trends. They also open space for mid-sized projects and specialised niches where alternative investment vehicles can play a meaningful role.

Whether this momentum becomes a sustained cycle or a post-adjustment rebound will depend on several variables: financing conditions, the pace of interest-rate normalisation, regulatory stability in rental and housing policy, and the ability of local markets to generate new development pipelines. For now, Spain stands out as one of Europe’s strongest investment stories—an outcome few analysts would have predicted just two years ago.
