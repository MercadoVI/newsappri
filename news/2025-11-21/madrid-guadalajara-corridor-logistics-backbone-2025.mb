Spain’s logistics market closes 2025 with sustained momentum, supported by solid demand fundamentals and the sector’s ability to absorb new supply across the country’s main distribution hubs. According to CBRE, national logistics take-up exceeded 710,000 square metres in the first quarter of the year — a figure significantly above recent averages and more than double that recorded in the same period of 2024, underscoring the segment’s position as one of the strongest performers in Spanish real estate.

Within this landscape, the Central Region maintains its dominant position. Data from JLL indicate that logistics leasing activity in the Madrid area reached approximately 822,000 square metres between January and September 2025, representing a 22% year-on-year increase. Investment in logistics assets in the region totalled around €395 million, equivalent to 34% of all logistics investment in Spain over the same period. Prime rents stand at around €6.90 per square metre per month — an annual rise of nearly 5% — reflecting a market with further room for rental growth but still competitive compared to other European hubs.

The Madrid–Guadalajara corridor, structured along the A-2 motorway and the historic Henares Corridor, concentrates a substantial portion of this activity. The consolidation of e-commerce operators, food distribution chains and advanced logistics providers has reinforced the strategic value of this area, which combines proximity to Madrid, strong multimodal connectivity and the availability of land for large-format warehouses. Estimates released during the most recent edition of Logistics Spain, held in Marchamalo, show that logistics activity supports more than 30,000 direct and indirect jobs in the province of Guadalajara, highlighting the sector’s economic relevance in the region.

Institutional dynamics have also strengthened. Logistics Spain has become one of the leading professional events in the sector, promoting coordination among operators, public administrations and training centres. The forum has emphasised the need to bolster critical infrastructure such as the Guadalajara-Marchamalo Dry Port, an intermodal facility connected to the ADIF rail network that serves as a catalyst for freight flows and for the decarbonisation of supply chains. Plans to expand its capacity and complement the corridor’s logistics offering are advancing in parallel with strong corporate interest in developing next-generation distribution centres.

Investor appetite is aligned with an increasingly robust market environment. Reports from Colliers show that overall logistics investment in Spain exceeded €1.3 billion in the first three quarters of 2025, with Madrid and Barcelona absorbing most of the capital. Investors view the Madrid–Guadalajara corridor as a deep, liquid market capable of supporting acquisition, repositioning and portfolio-aggregation strategies, with occupancy levels that continue to underpin stable income profiles.

Despite this positive backdrop, competition from other nearby locations is increasing. Certain areas of Castilla-La Mancha offer cost structures — particularly labour and land — that tend to be more contained than those of Madrid and Guadalajara. Analysts note that these differentials, combined with greater availability of affordable land, are attracting logistics projects that aim to optimise operating expenses while remaining within the orbital logistics ecosystem of the capital.

Infrastructure pressure, urban-planning timelines and the need for qualified labour are also shaping the debate on future competitiveness. Maintaining the corridor’s appeal will require coordinated public-private efforts to ensure capacity, connectivity and resilience in the face of growing demand.

Even so, the available evidence points to a clear conclusion: the Madrid–Guadalajara corridor has consolidated its status as the backbone of Spain’s logistics sector. Its combination of scale, infrastructure and long-term growth potential positions it as one of the key territories in national and international distribution strategies at a time when supply chains are shifting towards more resilient, technology-enabled and consumer-centric models.
