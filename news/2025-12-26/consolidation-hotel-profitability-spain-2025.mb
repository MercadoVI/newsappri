The Spanish hotel sector has entered an exceptional phase of maturity during the 2025 fiscal year, characterized by resilient demand and, above all, a capacity for revenue optimization that has driven profitability metrics to historic levels. According to data from the **INE Hotel Occupancy Survey**, the market has successfully absorbed seasonal fluctuations through a robust pricing strategy, consolidating the hotel asset as one of the most stable components of the national real estate portfolio.

### I. Value Metrics: The Rise of ADR and RevPAR

The profitability of a hotel asset is defined by its ability to maximize **Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR)**, and 2025 data shows a solid upward trend. In **November 2025**, Spanish hotels achieved an **Average Daily Rate (ADR) of €117.1**, reflecting adaptive and value-oriented revenue management.

This pricing level translates into a **national RevPAR of €77.5**, a figure that becomes especially relevant when analyzed by category. For institutional investors, the **luxury segment** remains the primary growth engine: **five-star hotels** recorded an **ADR of €261.6** and a **RevPAR of €177.1**, confirming that high-impact tourism maintains inelastic demand even in the face of price increases.

### II. Occupancy Dynamics and Seasonality Mitigation

One of the key achievements of 2025 has been the improvement in occupancy during traditionally weaker months. The INE survey indicates that **53.7% of available bed-places were occupied in November**, with particularly strong performance on weekends, where occupancy rose to **61.1%**.

This stabilization of occupancy is critical for asset valuation, as it reduces cash-flow volatility throughout the year. The sector has progressively reduced its reliance on the traditional “sun and beach” model, shifting toward **urban, cultural, and business tourism**, which sustains demand in major hubs on a year-round basis.

### III. Investment Geography: Traction Hubs in 2025

The territorial distribution of overnight stays highlights the importance of strategic location. During the winter period of 2025, the **Canary Islands** consolidated their position as the leading destination for international travelers, capturing **42.6% of non-resident overnight stays**. Southern Tenerife, particularly **Arona**, posted occupancy levels well above the national average, reaffirming its status as a core market for yield-oriented investors.

At the same time, **urban tourism** continues to perform strongly. **Catalonia** accounted for **14.4% of non-resident nights**, while the **Community of Madrid** remained the second most popular destination for resident travelers, concentrating **13.8% of domestic overnight stays in November**. This dual dynamic—leisure islands and urban centers—offers a diversified geographical investment profile within Spain.

### IV. The Impact of International Demand

International demand remains the backbone of hotel performance in 2025. While domestic tourism shows signs of normalization, **overnight stays by non-resident travelers grew by 3.0% in November**, surpassing **20.3 million hotel nights**.

The **United Kingdom and Germany** continue to be the main source markets, but the growing contribution of **France, the United States, and Italy**—markets with higher average spending—adds qualitative depth to demand. This diversification reduces exposure to cyclical slowdowns in any single European economy and strengthens the sector’s resilience.

### V. Year-End Outlook and Strategy for 2026

The **Hotel Price Index (HPI)** recorded an annual increase of **3.9%** toward the end of 2025, confirming the sector’s ability to pass cost pressures through to final prices without materially affecting occupancy. This pricing power suggests further room for organic growth.

Looking ahead to 2026, investor strategy should focus on **asset upgrading toward higher categories (4 and 5 stars)**, where ADR and RevPAR offer wider margins and better protection against operating cost inflation. The data from 2025 confirms that the Spanish hotel sector has not only recovered volume but has structurally transformed its business model toward **efficiency, quality, and yield stability**, positioning hotels as a **high-performing safe-haven asset** within the real estate universe.
