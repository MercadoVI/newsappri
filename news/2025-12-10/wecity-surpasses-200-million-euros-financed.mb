Wecity Surpasses 200 Million Euros Financed: Leadership Defined by a 0% Default Rate
A Historical Milestone Redefining Alternative Real Estate Investment
Wecity has rapidly cemented its position as an essential benchmark in Spain's real estate crowdlending ecosystem. A recent platform announcement underscores its spectacular growth: they have surpassed 200 million euros (€200 M) financed since their founding in 2023.

This milestone is not just a number, but a reflection of investor confidence in a model that seeks to democratize access to the high returns of the institutional real estate market. The platform's trajectory is summarized by impressive metrics:

152 Projects financed.

An average project term of 11 months.

An average return since inception that amounts to 12.61%.

A 0% default rate, which validates the rigor in the selection and structuring of their operations.

The Wecity Formula: Secure and Profitable Debt Structures
Wecity specializes in offering crowdlending opportunities with guarantees, focusing primarily on the Developer Loan (Interest) modality, which provides a fixed interest linked to the investment.

The platform's operations stand out for their focus on risk mitigation, as demonstrated in one of their most recent projects (Madrid Atlas Ahijones Project):

Madrid Atlas Ahijones Project: A loan operation of €365,000 intended to finance the VAT for a plot of land in Los Ahijones.

Reinforced Security: The project was backed by the pledge of the VAT refund from the Tax Agency.

Minimal Commercial Risk: The development of 18 VPPL homes was pre-sold in 17 of its units.

Extreme Liquidity: The combination of low risk exposure and high profitability (10.50% Annual TIN) led to an instant closure in under 30 seconds after the initial restriction was lifted, confirming the extremely high demand for well-guaranteed assets.

Current Opportunities and a Look to the Future
Wecity's accumulated success translates directly into benefits for its community. To thank the trust that led to surpassing the €200 million mark, Wecity has announced an attractive bonus:

Doubled Bonus: From 12/10/2025 to 12/31/2025, the platform is doubling its bonus.

Referrals: By sharing the referral code, both the existing investor and the new one (after their first investment) receive €100 in their wallet.

Looking ahead, Wecity's upward trajectory suggests a consolidation of its leadership. The company has already closed high-volume participatory financing rounds, such as a €3 million round for the purchase of a commercial property in Madrid, and has positioned itself as the platform with the largest financing round in the Spanish real estate crowdfunding market.

By maintaining its focus on high value-added operations (Capital Gain, Rental Income, and Interest) and a 0% default rate, Wecity is ready to continue setting the pace and exceeding new financing milestones in the coming years.
