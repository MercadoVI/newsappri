Spain is entering a decisive phase in its energy transition, and the country’s major utilities have activated investment plans of a scale that is reshaping both the industrial landscape and the environment in which the real estate sector operates. The government has recently announced a new support package of roughly €2 billion aimed at accelerating decarbonisation, strengthening the industrial value chain and speeding up electrification. These measures build on existing programmes under the national Recovery Plan and contribute to a stable investment pipeline in energy infrastructure.

This public push coincides with significant expansion across the private sector. Iberdrola has presented its 2025–2028 strategic plan, which includes €58 billion in global investment, largely directed toward regulated networks and renewable generation in advanced regulatory environments. Spain remains one of the company’s core markets in terms of asset base and project pipeline. Endesa, meanwhile, has raised its investment commitment to €8.9 billion through 2026, with a clear focus on digitalising its grids, integrating renewable energy and supporting the electrification of households and industry. Naturgy maintains a €6.4 billion plan running to 2027, centred on distribution networks, renewable projects and infrastructure modernisation, complemented by the rollout of its first major battery-storage systems in Spain.

Storage has emerged as a strategic asset. Naturgy has begun executing ten projects totalling around 160 MW of power capacity and slightly above 300 MWh of storage, partially financed through EU funds. These assets will help absorb renewable generation peaks and facilitate the integration of new solar and wind facilities. In parallel, Spain’s latest electricity transmission planning foresees around €13.6 billion in investment through 2030 to reinforce and expand the national grid — a critical step to accommodate emerging industrial demand and reduce congestion at key nodes.

These developments are increasingly relevant for the real estate sector. The expansion of data centres — expected to grow sharply according to industry associations — relies on robust grid capacity, redundant power connections and access to renewable energy. Madrid is consolidating its position as one of Southern Europe’s most important digital hubs, propelled by major cloud projects and the availability of industrial land connected to the electricity network. Energy infrastructure is now a foundational element in enabling these developments.

Logistics real estate is also being reshaped by the energy transition. Fleet electrification, on-site charging, rooftop solar and the need for more resilient power connections are raising the technical requirements of logistics assets. Areas located near reinforced substations or major transmission corridors may gradually become more attractive, not because of direct subsidies, but because grid availability directly influences operational feasibility for logistics operators and last-mile distribution networks.

On the industrial front, several autonomous communities are leveraging new energy investments to attract electro-intensive industries and green reindustrialisation. Competitive renewable energy and improved grid infrastructure can influence site-selection decisions and, in turn, create demand for industrial land and housing in areas that were not traditionally prioritised by real estate investors.

The continued rollout of renewable energy projects is also sustaining demand for rural land, particularly for solar and wind developments and for the associated evacuation infrastructure or storage hubs. While no official data allow for precise forecasts on price impacts, the trend indicates sustained interest in parts of inland Spain with strong solar resources and accessible grid connection points.

For real estate investors, these shifts should not be interpreted as a guarantee of immediate returns but rather as a structural change in market fundamentals. Grid capacity, connection availability and access to renewable energy are becoming as relevant as location and transport links in the assessment of industrial, logistics and technological assets. Even in residential development, the electrification of consumption and increasingly stringent energy-efficiency regulations are influencing design choices, cost structures and the appeal of new projects.

Spain is moving into a decade in which energy and land development will be more intertwined than ever. The accelerating investment cycle of the utilities, combined with government-led grid planning and progress in storage, is establishing energy infrastructure as a structural factor that will shape real estate activity. For market participants, understanding this interdependence will be key to anticipating where new opportunities may emerge and which regions could gain relevance in the coming years.

Realty Investor: a project under development
Realty Investor is building a digital platform that will centralise all real estate crowdfunding and crowdlending opportunities in a single environment. Its goal is to enable investors to discover, compare and invest in projects from one application, with verified information, comparable metrics and an optimised mobile experience. The project is currently under development, driven by a team specialised in investment and real estate. Join the early-access list and receive one month of free access to the app upon launch.
