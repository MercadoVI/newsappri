Inflation Rises to 3.1% in October: The Impact on Real Estate’s Real Returns in Spain

This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute, under any circumstances, investment advice or a recommendation.

Inflation in Spain has regained momentum. According to the National Statistics Institute (INE), the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 3.1% year-on-year in October 2025, while core inflation —excluding energy and unprocessed food— eased to 2.5%. Although far from the peaks reached during the 2022 energy crisis, this marks the highest level of the year and confirms that price pressures have not fully dissipated.

The rebound is mainly driven by rising electricity and fuel costs after several months of declines. Energy inflation remains particularly sensitive to geopolitical instability and volatile oil prices —factors that continue to cloud the outlook as winter approaches.

The uptick comes amid a still-restrictive monetary environment. In its October 30th meeting, the European Central Bank (ECB) left interest rates unchanged, keeping the deposit facility at 2.00%, the main refinancing rate at 2.15%, and the marginal lending facility at 2.40%. The ECB maintains a cautious tone: while inflation is gradually converging toward its 2% target, it warns that an early relaxation of policy could jeopardize price stability.

At the same time, the 12-month Euribor, Spain’s main mortgage benchmark, averaged around 2.19% in October, its lowest level in almost two years. The slight decline has begun to ease the financial burden of new mortgages, but borrowing costs remain high compared with the long-term average —a factor that continues to restrain housing demand.

### A Fragile Balance Between Inflation, Interest Rates, and Housing Demand

Spain’s real estate market enters this new inflationary phase with a mixed outlook. On one hand, rising prices erode household purchasing power and savings capacity; on the other, property continues to act as a hedge against monetary depreciation. In an environment where cash steadily loses value, real assets remain an appealing store of wealth.

According to Tinsa, residential property prices in Spain rose 12.3% year-on-year in September 2025, reaching an average of €2,021 per square meter. The upward trend persists, driven by limited supply, international demand, and strong domestic appetite in large urban areas such as Madrid, Barcelona, and Málaga.

However, housing supply remains insufficient to meet structural demand. Data from the Ministry of Transport and Sustainable Mobility show 84,061 new building permits between January and July 2025, up 10.9% from the same period a year earlier. While the increase is welcome, it still falls short of the estimated 200,000 annual units needed, according to the developers’ association APCEspaña.

### Real Returns Under Pressure

In this environment, inflation becomes a decisive factor for property investors. While gross rental yields in major cities remain stable —between 5% and 6%, according to Idealista—, real returns shrink significantly once inflation is taken into account. With a 3.1% CPI, the inflation-adjusted yield barely exceeds 2% in many cases.

This narrowing gap highlights the need for a more analytical and diversified approach. Investors are increasingly focusing not only on capital appreciation but also on stable cash flows capable of offsetting inflation’s erosion. In this regard, the build-to-rent market and collective investment models such as real estate crowdfunding are gaining traction by offering access to periodic income with reduced individual exposure.

### Information and Transparency: The New Market Foundations

The current phase of moderate but persistent inflation presents a structural challenge: the value of an asset no longer depends solely on its location or demand, but also on the quality of information available to assess its real profitability. In a market historically marked by opacity, digitalization is now bringing greater transparency, comparability, and traceability to property data.

The ability to analyze projects using standardized metrics —from expected cash flows to interest-rate sensitivity— is transforming how individuals approach real estate investing. The combination of technology, verified data, and retail access is shaping a new investment landscape that is more rational and less speculative.

### Real Estate as a Dynamic Hedge

Ultimately, inflation does not diminish property’s appeal —it redefines it. Real estate is no longer just a store of wealth but a dynamic tool for preserving value in a shifting monetary environment. Spain, which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects to be the fastest-growing advanced economy in 2025, combines solid macroeconomic fundamentals with persistent housing demand —factors that continue to sustain investor confidence even amid price tensions.

The challenge for companies and individuals alike will be to identify opportunities capable of maintaining positive real returns. Transparency, diversification, and access to reliable information will be the cornerstones of this new era in Spanish property investment.

### Realty Investor: A Project in Progress

Realty Investor is developing a digital platform that will centralize all real estate crowdfunding and crowdlending opportunities in a single environment. Its goal is to allow investors to discover, compare, and invest in projects from one application, with verified information, comparable metrics, and an optimized mobile experience.  
The project is currently under development, led by a team specialized in investment and real estate.
