Recent public debate on the reform of the Corporate Tax (IS) in Spain, together with approaches to advance a reform of the regional financing model—which could include measures to “harmonize” taxation across autonomous communities—has created a climate of regulatory uncertainty affecting perceived risk in the institutional real estate sector. (Forbes España)
Current tax framework for institutional vehicles
The special regime for SOCIMIs (Spanish listed real estate investment companies) remains in force: these companies are taxed at 0% under Corporate Tax provided they meet regulatory requirements (mandatory dividend distribution, asset retention, etc.). (Mondaq)
This makes SOCIMIs a fiscally preferred vehicle for real estate investment and a widely used instrument among institutional investors.
Regulatory tension factors
In recent years, Corporate Tax has undergone numerous modifications: according to the General Council of Economists, from 2015 to 2025 there have been 38 regulatory changes affecting the tax, generating—according to consulted tax experts—greater complexity and high compliance costs. (Europa Press)


In 2025, the Government announced measures to encourage business capitalization—including tax reductions for SMEs and micro-enterprises—which could increase pressure on large corporations to contribute more fiscally, in a context of shrinking tax advantages. (El País)


Given the SOCIMIs’ special regime, any legal change, modification of Corporate Tax, or general tax reform could alter their comparative attractiveness versus other real estate investment vehicles in Europe, creating a fiscal competitiveness risk for Spain.


Risk for institutional real estate investment
In this context, several factors generate a real regulatory risk for institutional real estate investment:
An increase in the effective Corporate Tax rate for large companies could reduce net margins for developers, managers, or real estate funds, affecting expected returns.


SOCIMIs, whose favorable taxation is central to their model, could see their regime altered if specific reforms were introduced, impacting their attractiveness as an investment vehicle.


Potential regional tax harmonization could reduce advantages in certain regions (fiscal or regulatory) traditionally considered favorable, influencing location decisions for residential, logistics, or prime office investments.


Conclusion
Although no reform has been approved that definitively changes the Corporate Tax regime or SOCIMIs, the climate of public discussion, the frequency of regulatory changes, and proposed fiscal adjustments increase uncertainty. This regulatory risk is real and should be considered by investors and institutional real estate actors as a key factor in evaluating medium- and long-term projects.
To preserve market stability and predictability, the sector requires a clear, coherent, and durable fiscal framework. The combination of attractive taxation and regulatory stability will continue to be decisive in attracting investment to Spanish real estate.

If desired, a scenario table (optimistic / conservative / high-risk) could also be prepared, illustrating possible consequences for real estate investment in Spain under different changes in Corporate Tax or SOCIMI regulations.
