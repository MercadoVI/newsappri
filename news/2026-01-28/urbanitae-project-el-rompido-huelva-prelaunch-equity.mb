Investment Summary  
Project Type: Equity (Capital Gain).

Location: El Rompido, Huelva (Costa de la Luz).

Funding Target: €1,303,000.

Estimated Term: 34 - 38 months.

Preferred Return (IRR): 13%.

Assets: 25 homes (16 semi-detached and 9 multi-family units).

Asset Analysis: Exclusivity and Panoramic Views  
Project El Rompido involves the construction of a residential complex on a 7,000-square-meter plot. The architectural design leverages the unique topography of the terrain, placing the development at the highest point of the "El Rompido Oeste" sector.

This privileged position guarantees uninterrupted views toward the Piedras River estuary and the La Antilla coastline for all units. The development is divided into two distinct typologies:

16 Semi-detached single-family homes: A scarce product in the area catering to the demand for greater privacy.

9 Multi-family units: Integrated apartment units within a gated community.

The complex will feature high-end common areas, including a swimming pool, gym, and green spaces, designed to maximize the enjoyment of the Atlantic climate and the natural surroundings of the Marismas and the "Flecha del Rompido."

Strategy and Project Execution  
Urban and Technical Status  
Unlike other developments, this project sits on consolidated urban land. The plot is already fully urbanized with all utility networks installed, pending only the final administrative reception by the local council.

To mitigate execution risks, construction will be carried out by the developer’s in-house construction firm, which has an extensive track record in the region. This ensures strict control over production costs (estimated at €8,002,040) and compliance with technical deadlines.

Financial Structure and Alignment  
The operation will be executed via a capital increase. Urbanitae investors will provide €1.3 million, while the developer will co-invest €400,000 of their own equity.

This structure ensures a total alignment of interests, reinforced by a profit-sharing scheme with a preferred IRR:

Urbanitae investors recoup their initial capital plus a 13% return.

Once this return is satisfied, the developer recoups their capital and an equivalent return.

Surplus profits are split 40% for the developer and 60% proportionally among all capital holders.

Furthermore, financial viability is backed by a tier-1 banking institution, with whom developer financing has already been agreed to cover the project’s development.

Economic Scenarios (CNMV Compliance)  
In compliance with regulatory standards, three potential scenarios have been defined:

Favorable (Base): Total revenue of €9,052,500 and costs of €8,002,040.

Moderate: Contemplates a 20% increase in construction costs, raising total expenses to €8,288,715.

Unfavorable: Foresees a 20% increase in construction costs and a 10% reduction in sales prices, resulting in €7,951,500 in revenue and €8,106,620 in costs, implying a partial loss of capital.

Why Invest in El Rompido?  
Competitive Advantage: Semi-detached homes with sea views are virtually non-existent in the current local market supply.

Mitigated Planning Risk: Consolidated urban land with existing infrastructure already completed.

Confirmed Bank Backing: Developer financing already agreed upon with a major bank.

Strong Second-Home Demand: El Rompido is a consolidated destination featuring a marina and golf courses, ensuring strong commercial absorption.

Q1 2026: Capital increase and start of marketing.

Q4 2026: Start of building construction.

Q2 2028: Completion of construction.
