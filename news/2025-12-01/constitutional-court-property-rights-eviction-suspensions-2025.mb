The Spanish real estate sector, a pillar of economic growth, has received a significant boost to its legal certainty with the recent ruling by the Constitutional Court (TC) issued on November 18. The decision, unanimously passed by the Second Chamber, granted amparo (protection) to a private owner and declared the annulment of several previous judicial resolutions that had maintained the suspension of a launch (eviction) due to illegal occupation, despite the legal requirements not being met.

The decision by the High Court addresses the application of emergency housing regulations, specifically Article 1 bis of Royal Decree-Law 11/2020. The TC determined that the lower court had "arbitrarily" excluded the case from the scope of the corresponding regulation, thus violating the owner's fundamental right to effective judicial protection (Article 24 of the Spanish Constitution).

In essence, the controversy centered on the distinction between vulnerable tenants and occupants without title. The regulation limited the suspension of the launch for occupants without title only if the property was owned by a large landlord (a legal or natural person with more than ten homes). However, the court maintained the suspension without analyzing whether the new owner, a private individual who was not considered a large landlord, met the requirement. The TC ruling corrects this overreach, setting a fundamental precedent: the extraordinary suspension due to vulnerability is neither a general nor an automatic measure, and its application must be strictly motivated and consistent with the owner's situation.

For the residential investment market, this ruling has a triple impact. Firstly, it reinforces the position of the small owner and private investor. By establishing clear limits on the suspension figure, it provides greater certainty to the investor who acquires residential assets without being categorized as a large landlord, reducing the risk of unjustified delays in recovering their property. Secondly, although the case focuses on a private individual, the legal clarification benefits the sector in general by demanding a rigorous application of the criteria for large landlord status and vulnerability, an element that has been a focus of regulatory instability in recent years. Finally, the ruling helps to redefine the balance between the social right to housing and the right to private property. By ensuring that access to judicial protection is effective and without disproportionate obstacles, the Court sends a clear signal of support for the legal security of real estate assets, an essential factor for attracting and retaining institutional and private capital investment in the rental market.

The judicial precedent adds to a series of Constitutional Court rulings in 2025 that have been dismantling certain procedural obstacles, such as the obligation for large landlords to prove vulnerability for the admission of eviction lawsuits. The message is unequivocal: housing policies cannot translate into impediments that empty the owner's right to recover their asset of content.
