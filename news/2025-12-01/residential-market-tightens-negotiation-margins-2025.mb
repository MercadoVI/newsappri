RESIDENTIAL MARKET TIGHTENS: MOST BUYERS ACCEPT SHRINKING NEGOTIATION MARGINS

Madrid, November 29, 2025.

The Spanish residential sector, fueled by robust demand and structurally scarce supply, has consolidated a clear seller’s market dominance, significantly limiting buyers' ability to secure discounts. According to the recent Experience in Purchase-Sale in 2025 report by Fotocasa Research, the downward negotiation margin has continued its decreasing trend, reflecting current price tension.

The study reveals that the percentage of applicants who venture to attempt to lower the initial price of a property has diminished in recent years. The figures show a tightening of conditions, where the willingness to negotiate has decreased. On the seller's side, those who are open to negotiation have fallen to around 57%, which directly pressures buyers to accept initial valuations. The direct implication for investors and private individuals is that the phase of major opportunities through negotiation, common in downturn cycles, is over.

The difficulty is not limited only to initiating negotiation but also to securing significant reductions. The report details that the vast majority of buyers who do manage to agree on a price lower than the asking price do not achieve a discount greater than 10%. Specifically, 77% of those who close a reduction remain below this threshold. This is key data, as it underscores that demand pressure does not allow owners to yield on their price expectations, maintaining upward sales profitability.

This dynamic is a direct reflection of the imbalance between supply and demand, which continues to sharpen in 2025. Appetite for home buying remains high, while available stock, especially second-hand property, is not growing at the same rate. For every seller who interacts with the market, there is an unsatisfied demand actively competing for the asset.

For the housing investor, particularly those operating in the secondary market, these data force a recalibration of yield expectations based on the acquisition price. In this hot market environment, not only are discount options reduced, but the time available to make purchasing decisions is also shortened. Over half of applicants close price adjustments in less than a month, which demands superior diligence and reaction capability compared to previous cycles. The conclusion for capital is clear: in 2025, price has become a less flexible factor, prioritizing the ability to close deals quickly over securing large negotiation margins.
