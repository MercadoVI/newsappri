Spain nears 50 million inhabitants: a new demographic baseline reshaping housing demand

This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute, under any circumstances, investment advice or a recommendation.

Spain is on the brink of a structural demographic shift. According to the latest Continuous Population Statistics published by the National Statistics Institute (INE), the country reached 49,442,844 residents as of 1 October 2025 —the highest figure on record— after gaining more than 105,000 people in the third quarter alone and roughly 474,000 over the past twelve months. Population growth is now at levels unseen in decades, driven overwhelmingly by immigration.

INE data shows that the number of residents born abroad stands at 9.8 million, while 7.1 million hold foreign nationality. The domestic impact of this trend becomes evident when looking at households: Spain now has 19.68 million households, an increase of over 55,000 in just three months. More people and more households inevitably translate into more pressure on a housing stock that was already structurally tight before this demographic acceleration began.

The tension between rapidly expanding demand and slower supply is reflected clearly in prices. The INE House Price Index recorded a 12.7% year-on-year increase in the second quarter of 2025 —the strongest rise in nearly two decades— with significant growth in both new homes and the second-hand market. On a quarterly basis, prices rose 4%. Private sector indicators mirror this pattern: Idealista places the average sale price at a historic high of €2,555/m², up 15.7% year-on-year, while rental prices have climbed 10.9%, reaching €14.5/m² nationally.

Analysts are increasingly linking this price escalation to the interplay between demographic pressure and insufficient new housing production. BBVA Research projects that new construction will grow by around 10% in 2025 and 12% in 2026, but warns that even this acceleration will be insufficient to offset the scale of household formation. As a result, both sale and rental prices are expected to continue rising —around 10% in 2025 and 7% in 2026 on average— unless supply expands more decisively.

The demographic surge is not uniform across Spain. While all autonomous communities grew in population during the third quarter, the strongest relative increases occurred in the Valencian Community (0.40%), Aragón (0.36%) and Castilla-La Mancha (0.34%). These regions also show notable activity in housing transactions and price dynamics, suggesting a more complex and polycentric pattern of demand that extends beyond Madrid and Barcelona. Urban corridors, coastal areas with strong employment or tourism activity, and well-connected medium-sized cities are absorbing a substantial share of new residents.

This demographic shift comes at a time when much of Spain’s housing stock is ageing, energy efficiency requirements are tightening, and urban planning processes remain slow. The convergence of population growth, rising household formation, and limited new development places housing policy at the centre of the economic agenda. Streamlined land transformation processes, accelerated urban planning, and a stronger push for affordable housing programmes will be critical to preventing the widening of gaps in accessibility between those able to purchase and those increasingly dependent on an overstretched rental market.

For the real estate sector, the approach of 50 million inhabitants is both an opportunity and a challenge. A larger population with sustained household formation provides a strong long-term demand base for residential assets. But the persistent mismatch between supply and demand, combined with regulatory and financial constraints, complicates decision-making for developers, investors and public authorities alike. Understanding the demographic map in detail —not just the headline figure— will be essential to anticipating where and how housing needs will intensify in the coming years.
