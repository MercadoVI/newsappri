Spain’s inflation holds at 3.1%: renewed pressure on the real estate market

This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute, under any circumstances, investment advice or a recommendation.

Spain’s inflation returned to the forefront of economic debate in October. According to the latest data published by the National Statistics Institute (INE), the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 3.1% year-on-year, the highest level since mid-2024, driven mainly by energy and certain service categories. Core inflation —which excludes energy and unprocessed food— reached 2.5%, while the monthly rate stood at 0.7%.

This trend contrasts with the evolution of prices in the eurozone, where Eurostat estimates inflation at around 2.1% for the same month. The widening gap stems largely from the behaviour of electricity, fuel and transport services, which have exerted upward pressure on the Spanish index in recent quarters.

Although the Bank of Spain continues to project a gradual convergence towards levels close to the ECB’s 2% target, the persistence of inflation above that threshold extends a period of tighter real interest rates. For real estate operators, this environment translates into more demanding financial conditions, especially for new developments, leveraged structures and long-duration projects.

In the residential market, inflation feeds directly into construction costs. Materials and activities with high energy intensity —such as HVAC systems, logistics and part of the industrialised construction supply chain— remain affected by rising input prices. This reduces margins in projects with closed budgets and reinforces the need for stricter cost management, particularly where delivery schedules are tight.

Inflation also erodes household purchasing power. Despite resilient employment and moderate GDP growth, the rise in prices for essential goods conditions households’ ability to save and delays purchase decisions for first homes or upgrades. For investors, this means demand dynamics remain robust but increasingly sensitive to financing conditions.

From a financial standpoint, the combination of 3.1% inflation and a eurozone still above target limits the likelihood of rapid rate cuts by the European Central Bank. Mortgage financing therefore remains more expensive than in the ultra-low-rate years, and the repricing of risk in new developments or acquisitions requires more conservative capital structures.

In the rental market, inflation exerts a dual effect: it pushes operating and maintenance costs higher, and it influences the annual indexation of rents. In the most constrained urban markets —where supply grows more slowly than demand— landlords retain some capacity to pass part of these pressures through to rents, although within the regulatory limits applicable in each region.

For institutional and professional investors, the key issue is not the 3.1% figure itself, but its duration. If inflation gradually converges towards the Bank of Spain’s projections —slightly above 2% in the medium term— core and core-plus assets will likely continue to offer a degree of inflation protection, provided rental income grows at least at a similar pace. However, if energy-related shocks persist, pressure on development and renovation costs could tighten margins across a wide range of strategies.

Overall, October’s 3.1% inflation reading highlights that the path to price normalisation remains uneven. For Spain’s real estate sector, it reinforces the importance of incorporating macroeconomic risk into investment and development strategies, at a time when demand remains strong but financing and cost structures are becoming more restrictive.
