Urbanitae is preparing to open the Casa Coral Project, a new capital-gain development that reinforces the platform’s presence in one of southern Europe’s most dynamic residential markets. With a total ticket of €1,472,500, an estimated duration of 26 to 30 months, and a preferred IRR of 14% for Urbanitae investors, the project expands the platform’s portfolio of high-end opportunities.

Casa Coral is located in the Cerro Artola residential area in Benahavís, a setting that combines privacy, proximity to the sea and immediate access to key destinations along the Western Costa del Sol. According to information published by Urbanitae, the project involves the construction of a new luxury villa featuring seven bedrooms, a gym, private pool, garden and garage, along with sea views thanks to its elevated hillside position. The villa is part of a dual development, alongside another adjacent unit also financed through Urbanitae, demonstrating the platform’s ability to scale complementary operations within the same environment.

With this launch, Urbanitae continues to consolidate its investment model based on curated projects, each structured and assessed independently. The platform reports that the building permit has already been requested and is progressing as scheduled. The development sits within an area characterised by low-density urban planning, high residential exclusivity and close proximity to premium hubs such as Marbella, Estepona, San Pedro de Alcántara and Puerto Banús, all less than 15 minutes away by car.

Urbanitae’s focus on this type of development reflects the broader evolution of the Costa del Sol property market, where international demand for new-build luxury villas has remained resilient. The platform continues to expand its presence in the premium segment, leveraging its capacity to centralise high-value real estate opportunities and make them accessible to both retail and qualified investors.

With Casa Coral, Urbanitae adds another strategically positioned development to one of Andalucía’s most prestigious residential areas, reinforcing its role as a leading issuing platform in Spain’s real estate crowdfunding ecosystem.
