Real estate portals inflate housing prices by up to 44%: the challenge of transparency in Spain’s property market

This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute, under any circumstances, investment advice or a recommendation.

A recent study by UVE Valoraciones, published by the real estate data outlet Brainsre News on October 29, 2025, reveals a significant gap between advertised housing prices and the actual closing prices recorded by notaries. According to the report, listings on platforms such as Idealista, Fotocasa, and Pisos.com overstate real sale prices by an average of 44%, underscoring a deep transparency problem in Spain’s residential market.

The gap, which has widened in recent years, stems from several structural causes. First, a persistent housing shortage in major cities fuels sellers’ expectations, leading them to inflate asking prices. Second, the architecture of online portals—where price verification is not mandatory—encourages a bias between perceived and real market value. The outcome is a market in which the visible price and the actual transaction price increasingly diverge.

### A structural imbalance in residential pricing
UVE Valoraciones’ analysis is based on notarised sales data, comparing officially recorded prices with active listings on leading platforms. In the Madrid region, for instance, the average notarised sale price stands around €3,000/m², while advertised prices exceed €4,300/m². In Barcelona, the pattern is similar: roughly €3,500/m² in closing prices versus €5,000/m² in listings. This mismatch is not isolated—it repeats across most provincial capitals, highlighting a nationwide information distortion.

In response, the Spanish General Council of Notaries has launched the Official Real Estate Statistics Portal, an open-access database that allows users to consult verified market data directly from notarised deeds. Its goal is to provide a counterbalance to unverified online listings, enabling professionals and investors to rely on empirical transaction data rather than speculative expectations.

Experts agree that this gap between asking and selling prices distorts decision-making for both homebuyers and investors. “The market needs consistent and verifiable data. Listing information and notarial data complement each other, but their current divergence can lead to serious valuation errors,” a spokesperson for UVE Valoraciones explains.

### Implications for investors and risk assessment
For individual investors, inflated asking prices can have a tangible impact on returns. In real estate investment—particularly through collective models such as crowdfunding and crowdlending—the expected yield depends directly on the acquisition price of the underlying asset. When this starting point is overstated relative to real market value, projected returns shrink and risk exposure rises.

The lack of reliable data also erodes confidence at a time when digital real estate investment is expanding rapidly. In 2025, according to the Spanish Real Estate Crowdfunding Association, total capital raised for residential projects is expected to surpass €400 million, up 35% year-on-year. But for the sector to grow sustainably, investors need verified and comparable information that allows them to evaluate projects with rigor and transparency.

### Toward a new standard of reliable information
Spain’s property market is entering a turning point. While online listing prices still shape social perception of value, notarial and registry data are emerging as the true reference for market reality. This shift could transform how investors assess projects and how platforms present information, fostering a culture of evidence-based decision-making.

Digitalisation and data intelligence now offer an opportunity to close the information gap. Integrating sources such as notarised deeds, land registries, and certified appraisals could yield more accurate and homogeneous indicators, reflecting actual—not speculative—values. Access to such reliable data will not only empower investors but also raise the overall professional standards of Spain’s real estate ecosystem.

In the coming years, transparency will evolve from an ethical goal into a competitive advantage. Those platforms and institutions that prioritise verified, traceable, and consistent information will attract more stable and sophisticated capital in a market where retail investors demand clarity and trust as much as yield.

### Realty Investor: a project under construction
Realty Investor is developing a digital platform that will centralise all real estate crowdfunding and crowdlending opportunities in a single environment. Its goal is to enable investors to discover, compare, and invest in projects such as Residencial Arcosur (Zaragoza) through one application, offering verified information, comparable metrics, and an optimised mobile experience.
The project is currently under development, driven by a team specialised in investment and real estate.
