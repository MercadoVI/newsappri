Spain’s economy slows to 0.6% growth in Q3: implications for the real estate market

This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute, under any circumstances, investment advice or a recommendation.

Spain’s National Statistics Institute (INE) confirmed on October 29 that the economy grew by 0.6% in the third quarter of 2025, two tenths less than in the previous quarter (+0.8%). Year-on-year growth stood at 2.8%, reflecting a gradual moderation of the expansionary cycle that began after the pandemic. The slowdown is largely explained by weaker household consumption and lower business investment, while external demand—particularly tourism—continued to contribute positively to GDP growth.

According to the INE, domestic demand made a smaller contribution to overall activity due to a reduction in household spending, affected by cumulative inflation and still-elevated interest rates. Although the European Central Bank has begun easing its monetary stance, financing costs for mortgages and corporate credit remain restrictive, keeping bank lending selective and cautious.

### A mild adjustment in the housing market
Spain’s housing market reflects this moderation in uneven ways across regions and segments. Data from the Spanish Association of Property Registrars show that in August 2025, there were 47,700 home sales, a 3.5% decline compared to the same month a year earlier. The drop is modest but signals a gradual cooling of demand, especially in the second-hand segment.

Despite this, prices have remained broadly stable. The Bank of Spain reports that the residential market shows no signs of generalized overvaluation, although it acknowledges “localised tensions” in major cities and tourist areas, where supply continues to fall short. The combination of scarce developable land, rising construction costs, and slow permit issuance continues to constrain new housing supply, sustaining price pressure in key markets.

Developers interviewed by El Economista and Cinco Días agree that the main threat to the sector is not a lack of structural demand but limited access to financing and insufficient housing stock in high-growth regions.

### Investors and the new geography of capital
While large institutional funds are recalibrating portfolios in light of a slower economy, international investment interest in Spain remains solid. According to CBRE, real estate investment between January and September exceeded €8.5 billion, up 44% compared with the same period in 2024. Most capital flows have targeted build-to-rent residential, logistics, and hospitality assets, driven by Spain’s political stability and relatively high yields compared with other European markets.

For retail investors, however, the environment has become more complex. Slower GDP growth and tighter credit conditions have reduced opportunities for direct property investment, strengthening the appeal of collective investment formats such as real estate crowdfunding. These platforms allow investors to diversify and access curated projects with small capital commitments—an increasingly relevant advantage when the cycle demands selectivity and careful analysis.

### Transparency and reliable data: the new market currency
The greatest challenge for investors—large and small alike—will be distinguishing sustainable projects from speculative ones. The digitalisation of the property market has improved access to information but also multiplied the volume and complexity of available data. The quality and reliability of information, more than projected yields, are becoming the market’s most valuable asset.

A slower-growth environment does not necessarily imply weakness in real estate but calls for a more rational, data-driven approach. The combination of technology, rigorous analysis, and diversification can redefine how individuals participate in the sector. Platforms that integrate verified datasets, real valuations, and transparent project monitoring can help reduce the information asymmetries that have long shaped Spain’s property market.

### Toward a more balanced cycle
Spain faces a soft adjustment rather than a structural downturn. The moderation of GDP growth, together with stable employment, suggests an “orderly cooling” scenario in which real estate investment will remain a key pillar of the economy. The sector’s resilience will depend on its ability to adapt financing models, improve regulatory efficiency, and harness digitalisation to build a more transparent, accessible, and balanced market.

### Realty Investor: a project under construction
Realty Investor is developing a digital platform that will centralise all real estate crowdfunding and crowdlending opportunities in a single environment. Its goal is to enable investors to discover, compare, and invest in projects such as Residencial Arcosur (Zaragoza) through one application, offering verified information, comparable metrics, and an optimised mobile experience.
The project is currently under development, driven by a team specialised in investment and real estate.
