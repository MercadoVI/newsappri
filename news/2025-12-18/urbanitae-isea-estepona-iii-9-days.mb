The real estate crowdfunding platform Urbanitae has confirmed the successful funding closure of the Isea Estepona III Project. This capital appreciation (Equity) operation, aimed at financing a 79-unit residential development in Estepona (Málaga), reached its €3,500,000 target over a period of 9 days.

This closure highlights a distinct capital behavior for long-term development strategies, moving away from the immediate liquidity characteristic of the debt tranches analyzed previously.

### Funding Dynamics: The Equity Investor Profile

Unlike the crowdlending operations analyzed recently—where debt projects were completed in minutes—the Isea Estepona III Project followed a longer maturation process. The final indicators reflect an investor profile oriented toward development margins:

Total raised: €3,500,000.

Closing time: 9 days (approx. 12,960 minutes).

Funding ratio: €270 per minute.

Number of investors: 841 participants.

Average ticket: €4,162 per investor.

The average ticket of €4,162 is significantly higher than that of debt operations such as Bunyola Hills (€1,967) or the Benasque Project (€1,972). This suggests a higher concentration of capital per investor, typical of operations where the time horizon is more extensive (36-40 months) and returns depend on the commercial success of the development.

### Risk Analysis and Sponsor Backing: The QUADRATIA Factor

The success of this sixth collaboration between Urbanitae and QUADRATIA appears to be based on the developer's execution track record and solid operational metrics:

Previous Commercial Success: Phases I and II of the Isea Estepona complex show pre-sale levels of 94% and 84%, respectively. This prior traction mitigates the absorption risk for the 79 new units.

Alignment of Interests (Skin in the game): The developer is contributing 15% of the total capital. This figure is significantly higher than the equity levels typically observed in recent debt tranches, reinforcing financial security for investors.

Urban Planning Certainty: Having fully completed the urban development of the sector (SURO-05), the operation eliminates administrative uncertainties that often delay timelines in new construction projects.

### Market Comparison: Equity vs. Debt

From a technical perspective, the €270/minute ratio reflects the lower liquidity of capital appreciation assets compared to debt. While debt projects often close at rates exceeding €40,000/minute, the strategy in Estepona prioritizes raising a capital volume three times larger, targeting investors seeking the developer's margin in one of the highest-growth areas of the Costa del Sol.

The strategic location, adjacent to the new Estepona Hospital, supports the "favorable scenario" projections which estimate revenues exceeding €38 million.
