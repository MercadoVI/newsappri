Reflections from an Iberian Real Estate Investment Fund Manager

Every year, a substantial volume of capital leaves Latin America in search of stability, the rule of law, and long-term value preservation. A significant portion of that capital ultimately finds its way to Europe or the United States—often through real estate investments.

This is hardly surprising. Latin America represents approximately USD 7.1 trillion in GDP, nearly 6% of global output—a region economically larger than Germany or Japan, and even larger than France and the UK combined. Yet, despite its scale, Latin America remains structurally underexplored as a capital-raising market by European real estate managers.

From my vantage point as a fund manager operating out of the Iberian Peninsula, the question is not whether to raise capital from LATAM, but when.

### When Is the Right Time to Raise Capital from Latin America?

Conventional wisdom often frames the question in binary terms:

During periods of crisis, when capital seeks refuge abroad?

Or during times of prosperity, when surplus capital looks for diversification?

The answer, based on experience, is both.

In moments of macroeconomic stress, capital preservation becomes paramount. In periods of growth, international diversification becomes a strategic priority. In both cases, real estate—particularly in stable European jurisdictions—plays a central role.

### Why Real Estate, and Why Iberia?

Latin American investors have long demonstrated a clear preference for tangible assets in transparent legal environments. Real estate offers exactly that: income generation, inflation protection, and long-term capital appreciation.

Spain, in particular, has been a major beneficiary of these dynamics. It is perceived as:

Politically and institutionally stable.

Familiar in language and business culture.

Accessible in terms of ticket sizes and market depth.

As a result, a meaningful share of Latin American outbound capital—especially from Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Argentina—has been allocated to Spanish real estate over the past decade.

### This phenomenon is not new: Lessons from the U.S. Experience

I still recall the years when significant capital flows from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Argentina, and Brazil fueled real estate investment in Miami, Manhattan, and Houston.

Those markets adapted quickly:

Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking teams.

Legal and tax structuring tailored to LATAM investors.

Asset management and reporting aligned with investor expectations.

Language was not a barrier; the market evolved to meet the investor.

### The Open Question: Portugal Beyond Brazil

Which leads me to a critical question: When will Lisbon develop that same level of specialization—beyond the Brazilian investor?

Portugal has done an excellent job positioning itself as a destination for Brazilian capital. However, Latin America is far broader and more diverse. There is meaningful untapped demand from:

Spanish-speaking South America.

Family offices and multi-family offices.

Entrepreneurs and second-generation wealth holders.

These investors are actively allocating abroad, often through private banks and investment bankers who are already well-embedded in markets such as Brazil, Chile, and Peru.

### A Natural, Yet Underleveraged Connection

While many European capital-raising efforts remain disproportionately focused on France, Germany, or the U.S., we are overlooking something fundamental: the natural cultural, historical, and diaspora-driven connection between Latin America and the Portuguese market.

These ties are not abstract. They are reflected in:

Shared business practices.

Family histories and migration patterns.

A growing LATAM presence in Iberian cities.

From an Iberian perspective, this represents not just an opportunity—but a strategic blind spot.

### Final Thought

Latin America is not a marginal source of capital. It is a structural allocator of global relevance. For real estate fund managers operating from Spain and Portugal, the opportunity is clear:

Build dedicated LATAM-focused capital-raising strategies.

Adapt structures, communication, and governance.

Think beyond traditional investor geographies.

The capital is already moving. The question is whether Iberia will fully position itself to receive it.
