The Trusters platform is set to launch today, Friday, February 13th, at 12:00 PM (UTC+1), a strategic investment opportunity in the heart of North Rome. The Via Luigi Amedeo Melegari 9 project involves the acquisition, comprehensive renovation, and subdivision of a 220 sqm stately asset in the prestigious Fleming district. Offering an annualized yield of up to 12.50% through Early Bird incentives and backed by a developer with a 100% repayment track record, this operation stands as one of the most robust opportunities in the Roman market this quarter.

Investment Overview
- Project Name: Via Luigi Amedeo Melegari 9 | Rome.
- Target Return: 10.50% base annual ROI (enhanced via bonuses).
- Loan Term: 12 months.
- Location: Fleming District, Municipio XV, Rome.
- Funding Goal: €250,000.
- Qualitative Rating: A.

The Asset: Value Creation in "Collina Fleming"
The intervention takes place on the fifth floor of an elegant building located in one of the capital's most exclusive residential areas. The value-creation strategy is based on the subdivision of the original unit to create three new independent apartments of approximately 65 sqm, 72 sqm, and 82 sqm.

Value Engineering & Sustainability
The project aims beyond spatial optimization, focusing on a total upgrade under the "Green Homes" philosophy (EU Directive 2018/844).

Premium Specifications: Units will feature home-automation-controlled climate systems, natural oak parquet flooring, and kitchens equipped with high-end appliances.

Panoramic Terraces: Each apartment will boast large terraces with views over Rome—a critical demand driver in the current luxury market.

Administrative Status: The operation is backed by a registered preliminary contract, and the CILA (work permit) has already been filed, allowing for an immediate start to construction.

Yield Structure and Early Bird Benefits
Trusters continues its loyalty policy for agile investors. Those who formalize their participation during the Pre-Booking phase can access higher return brackets.

Note: Interest payments will be distributed via quarterly coupons.

The Developer: IMMOVEO Srl and the "Instant Buyer" Model
The project's solvency is anchored by IMMOVEO Srl, a firm active since 2021 that has solidified its reputation on Trusters with four previous operations fully funded and repaid.

Track Record: The company has returned over €700,000 to the investor community, consistently ahead of schedule.

Capital Efficiency: IMMOVEO utilizes digital tools to generate immediate purchase offers, optimizing margins and significantly reducing "time-to-market."

Location & Market: The North Rome Microclimate
Collina Fleming is an enclave characterized by high living standards, tree-lined boulevards, and an elevated position offering panoramic vistas.

Connectivity: The area benefits from proximity to the Vigna Clara railway station and the future extension of Tram Line 2.

Price Dynamics: After steady growth since late 2022, the Fleming market reached a valuation peak in Autumn 2025. The subdivision strategy allows for capturing a price per square meter significantly higher than the original acquisition cost.
