The Spanish real estate market is witnessing an unprecedented structural transformation within the "Living" segment. According to the recent JLL report, "Flex Living in Spain," this market is in an aggressive expansion phase that promises to double its size over the next three years. This trend is not a temporary phenomenon but a direct response to a demographic transition that is reshaping housing demand in major urban centers and coastal areas.

JLL's analysis projects that Spain will exceed 53 million inhabitants by 2035, representing an increase of 3.8 million people (+7.8%) compared to the present. However, the most relevant data point for investors is not population growth per se, but the atomization of household units. The number of households is expected to grow by three million (+15%) by 2035, driven exclusively by one- or two-person households, which will represent 60% of the total. This shift toward smaller, more compact households validates the investment thesis for Flex Living: flexible housing solutions adapted to new lifestyles that the traditional residential model fails to satisfy efficiently.

### Strategic Concentration and Market Liquidity

The geography of Flex Living in Spain shows a deliberate concentration that favors liquidity for institutional investors. Madrid has consolidated itself as the absolute epicenter of the sector, accounting for 60% of the current operational stock and an impressive 72% of the projected pipeline. According to the JLL report, the Spanish capital has more than 25,000 beds between existing stock and future projects, making it the deepest and most competitive market in the country.

Barcelona, meanwhile, maintains a significant position with nearly 3,300 operational spots and 1,800 under development, followed closely by Valencia and Malaga. This urban hierarchy is no coincidence; it responds to housing pressure in areas with high professional and tourist density, where the conversion of assets—one of the key trends mentioned by JLL—allows for traction in established urban areas. For investors, this regional concentration reduces operational risks by benefiting from economies of scale and a captive demand from mobile and urban profiles.

### Capital Metrics and Profitability

From a capital markets perspective, the Living sector as a whole is experiencing a historic moment. JLL estimates that total investment could reach €4.5 billion by the end of 2025, which would represent a 56% increase compared to the previous year. The weight of this category within total national real estate investment has risen from 24% to 28%, consolidating its status as a strategic pillar for diversified portfolios.

Within this global figure, Flex Living specifically is expected to close 2025 with more than €300 million in transactions. This capital flow is attracting a new generation of operators and funds seeking to capture returns from a market in its maturation phase. The JLL report emphasizes that this growth will lead to a consolidation stage, where the entry of national capital and operator diversification will provide the market depth necessary to stabilize long-term valuations.

In conclusion, Flex Living has ceased to be an exotic alternative and has become a structural component of urban residential property in Spain. The combination of unmet demographic demand and record investment flow positions this segment as one of the clearest opportunities for capital deployment over the next three years.
