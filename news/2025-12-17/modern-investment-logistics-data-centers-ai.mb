### Logistics, the Pillar of Operational Efficiency

Following our previous analysis of the macroeconomic environment, the C&W European Outlook 2026 identifies the logistics sector not only as a resilient asset but as the direct beneficiary of the reconfiguration of global supply chains. Despite the slowdown in consumption that marked the beginning of 2025, the European logistics real estate sector has entered a maturity phase where quality and strategic location dictate market rules.

### Low Vacancy and Rent Growth

One of the most critical points highlighted in the C&W European Outlook 2026 report is the persistent shortage of high-quality supply (Grade A). Unlike previous cycles, vacancy rates in major European hubs remain at historically low levels. This imbalance between supply and demand has allowed rent growth to remain positive, acting as a natural hedge against inflation.

The analysis underlines that demand no longer stems solely from traditional e-commerce, but from the need for companies to relocate their inventories (nearshoring) to avoid the geopolitical disruptions seen in previous years. This has turned logistics into the sector with the greatest cash flow stability for institutional investors.

### Sustainability as a Value Differentiator

The report places special emphasis on the fact that sustainability is no longer optional. Logistics assets that integrate electric vehicle infrastructure, photovoltaic panels, and high energy efficiency certifications are capturing a "green premium" in both rents and capital valuation. Investors are penalizing obsolete assets, creating a unique opportunity for Value-Add strategies through the modernization of industrial warehouses.

### Data Centers: The Critical Infrastructure of AI

If there is one sector that has captured the full attention of the market in this last cycle, it is data centers. According to the C&W European Outlook 2026, this segment has moved from being an alternative niche to becoming an essential asset class, driven by the massive adoption of generative Artificial Intelligence.

### The Computing Demand Explosion

The AI revolution requires unprecedented data processing capacity. The C&W European Outlook 2026 details how demand for power and space in FLAPD markets (Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Dublin) has reached record levels. However, due to power grid restrictions in these cities, investment is shifting toward secondary markets with better access to renewable energy and grid capacity.

This asset class offers a unique characteristic: very long-term contracts with tenants of exceptional creditworthiness (hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Google, or Amazon). This provides income visibility that few other sectors can match in the current financial environment.

### Return Projections and Sector Conclusion

Within the projected total return for European real estate, logistics and data centers are at the forefront. The C&W European Outlook 2026 anticipates that logistics will remain a driver of dividend yield, while data centers will offer the greatest potential for capital appreciation due to the critical shortage of available supply against a demand that continues to scale.

In summary, while the general market benefits from monetary easing, these two sectors are advancing driven by structural tailwinds that go beyond the economic cycle. In our next and final article, we will analyze how more traditional sectors—such as Offices, Retail, and Living—are reinventing themselves to survive and thrive in this new ecosystem.
