The hotel real estate market in Spain faces the first stretch of the 2026 fiscal year in a context of operational stability and investor confidence, backed by the resilience of key sector metrics and the strength of cross-border demand. According to multiple reports and statistics from the hotel sector during 2025, main operational variables show positive indicators, with moderate growth in Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), Average Daily Rates (ADR), and occupancy, reflecting a consolidation after several years of strong activity.

Throughout 2025, the Spanish hotel sector maintained high activity levels in terms of revenue and occupancy. In the first half of 2025, RevPAR grew by approximately 6.9% compared to the same period in 2024, while ADR recorded an advance of nearly 6.5%, with occupancy rates stable at around 73% on national average.

The most recent data published by the National Statistics Institute (INE) confirms that, so far this year, hotel metrics continue to show growth and resistance. In September 2025, the average ADR was €131.4, an increase of around 5% compared to the same month in 2024, and RevPAR reached €102.5, an increase of more than 6% year-on-year.

### International Demand and Air Connectivity

International demand remains an essential pillar for the Spanish hotel industry. Although exact projections for the spring of 2026 have not yet been published by official bodies, sector sources indicate that the trend for bookings and arrivals from key source markets remains solid. Growth is expected from countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States for 2026, pointing to a sustainable demand base for the seasonal period.

This international demand support has allowed the Spanish hotel sector to maintain a balance between rates and occupancy without experiencing significant setbacks compared to the inflationary pressure affecting other areas of commercial real estate.

### Investment and Outlook for Hotel Assets

In the investment arena, hotel assets maintain a prominent position within the Spanish real estate market. According to data from Colliers, the volume of hotel investment in Spain reached €2.8 billion in the first three quarters of 2025, a significant increase over the previous year, consolidating the sector as one of the main focuses for real estate capital.

This dynamism responds both to operators' demand for well-located assets and the growing presence of domestic investors, who represented approximately 61% of the transacted volume through September 2025, with the remainder coming from diversified international capital.

The most attractive destinations for investors include both holiday and urban markets, with the Canary Islands, Barcelona, Madrid, and the Balearic Islands concentrating much of the transactional interest in hotels—spanning both established 4- and 5-star categories and products with strategic repositioning potential.

### Operational Conditions and Structural Challenges

While performance metrics indicate stability, the Spanish hotel sector faces structural challenges. These include:

Pressure on operational costs, including labor and energy, which can strain margins if rates do not offset expense increases.

Saturation in some mature tourist destinations, where competition and infrastructure management remain priorities.

These factors are part of the risk analysis that many consulting firms and asset managers are incorporating into their models for 2026, although they have not been translated into official predictions published by sector or statistical bodies as of the end of 2025.

### Trends by Segments and Destinations

In recent years, Spain has consolidated its position as one of Europe's most relevant hotel destinations in terms of performance and international visitor volume. In 2024, RevPAR reached historic record levels, with significant year-on-year growth compared to the pre-pandemic period, evidencing the structural strength of the Spanish hotel sector.

Geographical diversification of tourism and stable international demand also support the attractiveness of premium and luxury segments in both urban and holiday locations. Although specific projected occupancy data for spring 2026 has not been published in official reports, the recent operational trajectory and expectations for air connectivity support a vision of moderate growth and relative stability for that period.

Overall, these fundamentals indicate that the Spanish hotel industry enters 2026 with activity levels and operational indicators corroborated by the latest available figures, providing confidence to asset holders and potential investors regarding the sector's ability to absorb economic cycles and respond to international traveler demand.
