Iberia’s Workforce Housing Squeeze: A Structural Problem Hidden Behind Buyer Incentives  
As a real estate investment fund manager active across the Iberian Peninsula, I’m increasingly concerned about a growing imbalance in the housing market: the progressive exclusion of working-class and middle-income households who neither qualify for meaningful public support nor have the capital required to access homeownership.

Housing policy in both Portugal and Spain has leaned heavily toward stimulating demand — particularly among younger buyers — through tax relief, guarantees, subsidized credit, or preferential mortgage access. While politically attractive, these measures are creating artificial demand in already stressed urban markets, without addressing the structural issue: affordability driven by income levels versus housing production costs.

A Realistic Household Scenario  
Consider a dual-income household in their early-to-mid 40s, earning a combined €1,800–€2,200 per month, with stable employment and no major debt.

Using standard banking criteria (effort rate around 35–40%), their maximum affordable mortgage payment would be approximately €650–€850 per month. Under current interest rate conditions, this typically translates into a loan capacity in the range of €170,000–€210,000.

However, access to that loan requires:

- Down payment (typically 10–20%)
- Transaction costs (taxes, notary, registration, fees), often 6–10% of property value

In practical terms, this household would need €30,000–€45,000 in upfront savings.

If they manage to save 10% of their net income per month (an optimistic assumption), the time required to accumulate that capital can easily extend into well over a decade. Many families reach their peak earning years before they ever reach the entry point to ownership.

Supply Exists — But It’s Out of Financial Reach  
Across Iberia, the issue is not simply “lack of housing” in absolute terms. It is mismatch between price levels and household balance sheets.

In many secondary cities and peri-urban zones, there is:

- A substantial stock of existing housing
- Ongoing new development activity
- Units in the 60–90 sqm range, which in theory suit family needs

Yet the price per square meter in many markets — especially near employment hubs and transport infrastructure — has moved far ahead of what median-income households can finance under standard mortgage structures.

The barrier is not only price — it is equity requirement at entry.

The Risk of Demand Distortion  
Policies centered on stimulating specific buyer segments (often younger, first-time buyers) have two side effects:

- They concentrate purchasing power into already tight markets, particularly in major cities and coastal regions.
- They inflate prices in the short term, as government-supported buyers compete in limited supply environments.

This creates a market where price formation is increasingly influenced by policy-driven demand, rather than by wage growth and structural affordability.

If these incentives are reduced or removed, demand could soften abruptly, exposing a market where values have drifted away from the underlying income capacity of the broader population.

Meanwhile, households in their late 30s, 40s and 50s — often with dependents and stable jobs — are squeezed out. They earn too much for social housing, but too little to meet equity and financing thresholds.

Iberia Needs Supply-Side Reform, Not Only Buyer Incentives  
A structurally healthier housing market in Portugal and Spain requires cost and production reform, not only credit facilitation.

Key areas include:

- Reducing construction input costs (materials, logistics, energy)
- Supporting local industrial capacity in building components and finishes
- Streamlining licensing and planning processes, which remain lengthy and unpredictable
- Encouraging development beyond core metropolitan areas, where land and build costs allow for more attainable price points
- Enabling scale for professional developers, so fixed costs are spread across larger pipelines

Lower structural development costs translate directly into lower entry prices, which is the only durable way to align housing with income.

Conclusion  
Temporary incentives can support market activity, but they should not substitute structural housing policy.

A stable and inclusive Iberian housing market cannot be built on tax exceptions and credit guarantees alone. It must be built on:

- Efficient production
- Predictable planning
- Scalable development
- And price levels anchored to real household incomes

If we want long-term stability — for families, cities, and investors — the focus must shift from inflating demand to empowering supply
