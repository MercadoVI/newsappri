Moderation in the Pace of Transactions
Data published by the Colegio de Registradores indicate that the Spanish residential market continues along a path of moderation. Recent reports show that, following the strong momentum observed in 2021 and 2022, the number of registered property transactions has gradually adjusted throughout 2023, 2024, and 2025, in a context of more demanding financial conditions.
Although the Registrars have not yet released final figures for the end of 2025, they point to a continuation of the cooling trend seen in previous quarters. Market activity shows a more contained evolution, consistent with the slowdown in mortgage credit and the progressive normalization of demand following the post-pandemic expansionary cycle.
Mortgage Market Trends
Financing for home purchases has reflected this trend as well. According to the Bank of Spain, new mortgage loans have declined in volume over the past year, influenced by an environment of higher interest rates compared to previous years. The supervisory authority noted that the rate of new operations remains contained and that financing conditions continue to be stricter than during much of the past decade.
The moderation of mortgage credit has had a direct impact on financed transactions, which now represent a smaller share of total sales compared to the years of stronger expansion. This adjustment aligns with the European Central Bank’s monetary policy, which maintains rates at elevated levels to ensure price stability.
Price Evolution and Territorial Dynamics
Despite the reduction in activity, the Registrars’ Housing Price Index shows that property values remain high, with slight variations depending on location. The average price per square meter remains stable, without significant nationwide declines.
Territorial dynamics remain heterogeneous. Markets more exposed to international demand—such as the Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, or the Valencian Community—continue to show greater resilience. In contrast, interior regions experience a sharper adjustment in transaction volumes, consistent with demographic and economic factors reflecting lower relative dynamism.
Market Outlook
The Registrars emphasize that the market’s evolution in the coming quarters will largely depend on interest rate developments and households’ capacity to manage current financial conditions. Analysts agree that a potential reduction in official rates by the ECB could gradually reactivate credit and, in turn, property transaction activity.
Meanwhile, the supply of new housing remains limited, constrained by urban development timelines and structural production factors. This scarcity continues to exert pressure on prices in locations with strong structural demand.
