Digitalisation drives a new cycle of efficiency and transparency in Spain’s real estate sector

This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute, under any circumstances, a recommendation or investment advisory service.

Spain’s real estate industry is undergoing a structural technological transformation. Over the past few years, digitalisation has evolved from an emerging trend into a central driver of competitiveness — reshaping how assets are developed, managed and financed, and how investors interact with the market.

According to Deloitte Real Estate 2025, 82% of Spanish developers and asset managers have implemented digital solutions across at least one stage of their value chain. These range from document automation and predictive analytics to partial asset tokenisation and full portfolio management via cloud-based platforms. The consultancy notes that these innovations have significantly improved traceability, operational efficiency and the ability to anticipate market trends.

Major international consultancies are already leveraging artificial intelligence to refine decision-making. CBRE has incorporated predictive rent-modelling systems using energy, mobility and sociodemographic data to map rental growth patterns in urban areas. Meanwhile, Savills and Knight Frank employ big-data platforms to identify demand and absorption cycles in office and residential markets, enhancing valuation precision and reducing investment risk.

The expansion of blockchain and real estate tokenisation marks another milestone. Platforms such as Reental, Brickken and Token City are operating under CNMV oversight or within Spain’s regulatory sandbox, enabling the issuance of digitalised, fractional ownership stakes in real assets. While still in its early stages, this model opens access to smaller investors and introduces potential liquidity to traditionally illiquid markets.

At the same time, Spain’s proptech ecosystem continues to grow rapidly. The 2025 Finnovating map identifies over 400 active companies in the sector, placing Spain among Europe’s five most dynamic innovation hubs. These firms span a wide range of activities — from automating notarial processes and improving building energy efficiency to creating digital platforms for verified real estate investment.

Digitalisation is also transforming the experience of the end user. Leading portals such as Idealista and Fotocasa have evolved into advanced data-driven marketplaces, integrating valuation algorithms, yield estimators and price comparison tools previously available only to professionals. Financial institutions have followed suit: CaixaBank and BBVA, for example, now offer fully digital mortgage applications, reducing processing times and administrative complexity.

For property managers, technology has become a decisive profitability tool. According to EY Spain, adopting digital asset management systems can increase operational efficiency by 8–12%, thanks to real-time tracking of occupancy, maintenance and income flows. These solutions are particularly relevant for build-to-rent schemes and tokenised funds, where transparency and ongoing performance monitoring are essential for investor confidence.

However, increased connectivity also raises cybersecurity concerns. The Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) reported a 30% year-on-year increase in data breach complaints during the first half of 2025, reflecting the growing exposure of financial and personal information across industries. Although not specific to real estate, the trend highlights the need for stronger compliance frameworks and data-protection protocols within property firms and digital platforms alike.

Experts agree that technology will remain one of the main engines of growth for Spain’s real estate market. The convergence of digitalisation, sustainability and alternative financing models — such as real estate crowdfunding — is creating a new investment paradigm characterised by transparency, traceability and accessibility.

Spain is positioning itself as a regional benchmark in the fusion of technology and real estate. Its expanding proptech ecosystem, strong inflows of foreign capital and increasingly mature regulatory environment set the foundation for a more efficient, data-driven and inclusive market. In this new era, digitalisation is no longer an accessory — it is the backbone of the sector’s future.
