Spain’s upgraded economic outlook strengthens confidence in the real estate market

This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute, under any circumstances, a recommendation or investment advisory service.

Spain’s economy is entering a stronger-than-expected phase, with positive implications for its real estate sector. According to the OECD Economic Outlook, Volume 2025, Issue 1, Spain’s GDP is projected to grow by 2.4% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026, outpacing the euro area average and positioning the country among the bloc’s best-performing economies.

The OECD attributes this resilience to solid domestic demand, a robust labour market and steady real income growth. Household savings accumulated during the pandemic continue to support consumption, while the ongoing deployment of EU Recovery and Resilience Facility (Next Generation EU) funds under Spain’s Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan (PRTR) is sustaining both public and private investment. However, the organisation cautions that delays in project execution and the persistence of higher financing costs could temper momentum.

For the real estate market, this macroeconomic backdrop provides a structural tailwind. Growth above 2%, combined with rising household income and relatively moderate household debt levels compared with other European economies, is reinforcing both home-buying and rental demand. According to CBRE Spain, easing interest-rate pressures and a sustained recovery in tourism and mobility have helped Spain stand out as a regional exception amid the broader European slowdown.

Investment patterns are also adapting. Segments such as build-to-rent, senior living, and student housing continue to attract institutional capital, while diversification across residential, logistics and prime office assets remains strong. The growing appetite from domestic and international investors alike reflects confidence in Spain’s fundamentals and its ability to deliver stable, long-term returns.

Still, the environment presents challenges. Construction costs remain elevated following the inflationary surge of 2022–2023, and the scarcity of ready-to-build land, coupled with urban planning bottlenecks, continues to limit new housing supply. Developers face the dual task of maintaining profitability while integrating sustainability and energy-efficiency requirements under EU standards.

For collective investment vehicles and real estate crowdfunding platforms, the current cycle offers both opportunity and caution. Economic growth combined with gradually moderating interest rates provides fertile ground for investment diversification, yet risks persist — from delays in EU fund disbursements to global supply-chain tensions that could affect construction inputs.

Spain’s position, nonetheless, is comparatively strong. The country is transitioning toward a more mature and professional real estate market — less volatile, more data-driven, and increasingly integrated with sustainable finance. The combination of tourism recovery, infrastructure upgrades and digital transformation is setting the stage for a resilient sector capable of attracting capital even amid global uncertainty.

For investors, the message is clear: Spain’s macroeconomic stability and improving fundamentals are reinforcing its standing as one of Europe’s most attractive real estate markets. The key challenge ahead lies in ensuring that growth translates into balanced development — combining profitability with accessibility and long-term sustainability.
