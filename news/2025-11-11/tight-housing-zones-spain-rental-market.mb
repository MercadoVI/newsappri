Tight housing zones consolidate as the epicentre of Spain’s rental market: rising prices and insufficient supply despite regulation

Spain’s rental market continues to experience intense pressure, particularly in areas officially designated as “tight housing zones” (zonas tensionadas) under the 2023 Housing Law. Major cities —Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Málaga and Palma— are seeing sustained increases in demand and a dwindling housing supply, despite regulatory efforts to cap rent growth in certain regions.

According to Fotocasa’s October 2025 report, the average rental price in Spain rose by 14.3% year-on-year in the third quarter, reaching a new record high. This sharp rise is largely the result of a structural shortage of available housing, coupled with increased financing and construction costs that have discouraged landlords and developers from putting new rental units on the market.

The impact of rent control varies considerably between regions. In Catalonia, where 140 municipalities have been officially declared “tensioned areas,” the average rent has fallen by 6.4% in Barcelona and by 3.7% across the rest of the regulated zones, according to a September 2025 analysis by El HuffPost based on data from the Metropolitan Housing Observatory (Observatori Metropolità de l’Habitatge). However, the same study found a significant shift of supply toward temporary or tourist rentals, effectively reducing the stock of long-term housing and keeping pressure on local tenants.

In contrast, regions such as the Balearic Islands, the Valencian Community and Madrid, where rent caps have not yet been applied, continue to face rising prices. Data from Idealista show that the supply of long-term rental housing in Spain fell by 15% year-on-year between October 2024 and October 2025, while demand increased by 7% during the same period. In high-demand cities like Madrid and Málaga, listings receive an average of more than 20 enquiries per property within the first week of publication.

Experts identify supply rigidity as the central cause of this imbalance. Limited availability of developable land, lengthy urban planning procedures and fiscal pressure on rental income all contribute to the persistent shortage of affordable housing. Meanwhile, the Bank of Spain estimates the average gross rental yield at around 6.5%, which continues to attract small private investors. However, the regulatory uncertainty in some autonomous regions has slowed institutional-scale investment in build-to-rent projects.

Both CBRE and Savills argue that strengthening public–private partnerships is essential to alleviate the supply deficit. Several regional governments are negotiating long-term concession models to accelerate affordable housing development, with pilot projects already under way in cities such as Valencia and Zaragoza.

At a broader level, the OECD, in its Autumn 2025 Economic Outlook, warned that the lack of affordable housing could become a structural drag on urban competitiveness across Europe. The organisation called for fiscal incentives to promote private investment in affordable rental housing and urged faster rehabilitation of existing stock through administrative simplification.

In Spain, the Ministry of Housing has announced a programme to deliver 50,000 public rental units, developed jointly with regional governments and the Official Credit Institute (ICO). Yet the impact of this measure will be gradual, as the General Council of Economists estimates the current shortfall in affordable rental housing at more than two million units.

For investors, the situation presents a paradox. Strong demand ensures near-full occupancy rates, but rising costs and tightening regulation constrain net profitability. In this context, real estate crowdfunding and digital investment platforms offer a flexible and transparent channel for capital to flow into residential rental projects, enabling diversification and broader participation.

Spain’s rental market remains at a crossroads. Without faster land planning, stronger legal certainty and targeted incentives for rehabilitation, tensioned zones will continue to act as the thermometer of a structural imbalance between supply and demand — one that defines the country’s most pressing housing challenge.
