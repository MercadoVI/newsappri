Civislend has kicked off 2026 with a major statement in the real estate crowdlending market. The Residencial Ártico Madrid Project, which was scheduled to open today at 12:00 PM, successfully reached its €5,000,000 funding goal in a staggering 7 minutes.

This milestone is not only one of the largest single-tranche raises for the platform but also underscores the intense investor appetite for assets with solid collateral and conservative security metrics. With a fundraising rate of €714,286 per minute, this operation stands out as one of the most liquid in the sector at the start of this quarter.

### Closing Analysis: Investor Pulse and Diversification

The response from the investment community was massive, reflecting strong confidence in the first-rank mortgage guarantee structure.

### Key Funding Metrics

- **Total Amount Raised:** €5,000,000.  
- **Closing Time:** 7 minutes.  
- **Number of Investors:** 1,895 participants.  
- **Average Ticket:** €2,639.  
- **Fundraising Ratio:** €714,286 / minute.

Unlike other "flash" closings driven by large institutional tickets, the average ticket of €2,639 suggests a very active retail investor base, reinforcing Civislend’s ability to mobilize large volumes of capital in record time across a highly distributed network.

### The Pillars of Success: Why Did the €5 Million Fly?

The speed of the closing is a direct response to a value proposition where risk and reward were exceptionally balanced:

**1. A "Financial Shield" LTV (47%)**  
In a market where the average LTV (Loan To Value) for bridge loans on land is typically much higher, the 47% LTV of Residencial Ártico acted as a magnet for capital seeking safety. Having a guarantee appraised at €10.6 million to back a €5 million loan provides a 53% coverage margin.

**2. Commercial Validation (43% Pre-sold)**  
Having 28 out of the 65 homes already sold under the cooperative regime before opening the funding eliminated much of the commercial uncertainty, validating real demand in the Rivas-Vaciamadrid area.

**3. Strategic Location and Product**  
The project focuses on large multi-family housing, an asset class with high demand and low supply within the Madrid metropolitan area.
