Civislend has once again shattered its own speed records. The Badajoz Project, which offered an attractive total return of 15.00%, has completed its €2,500,000 funding in a record time of 210 seconds (3.5 minutes).

If the recent closing of Cala Major was already fast (130 minutes), today’s event in Badajoz demonstrates an unprecedented acceleration in retail investor decision-making, mobilizing capital at a staggering rate of €714,285 per minute.

Closing Analysis: Shaking Liquidity Metrics  
The operation stood out due to a massive concentration of investors in a minimal time window, confirming that the appetite for projects with first-rank mortgage guarantees and double-digit returns is structural.

Key Funding Metrics:

Total Amount Raised: €2,500,000.

Closing Time: 210 seconds (3.5 min).

Number of Investors: 1,115 participants.

Average Ticket: €2,242.

Fundraising Ratio: €11,905 / second (€714,285 / minute).

With an average ticket of €2,242, the closing was extremely granular, allowing more than a thousand investors to secure their position in an asset with a 56% total LTV and land already urbanized in a strategic area of Badajoz.

Factors for Success: The 15% Magnet and Trust in Domuscorp  
The market instantly validated the three pillars of this operation analyzed by Realty Investor:

1. Return vs. Risk (Initial 33% LTV) Offering a 15% total return with a first disbursement protected by a 33% LTV on assets appraised at €4.5 million was the primary driver of the closing. Investors identified the Badajoz Project as one of the quarter's best opportunities in terms of risk premium.

2. Developer Track Record This marks the third consecutive success for DOMUSCORP S.L. on Civislend. The fact that their previous two projects (Campus Badajoz and Villas del Guadiana) are progressing as planned generated the necessary confidence for capital to flow in a matter of seconds.

3. Alignment of Interests The developer's contribution of €2.7 million in equity (52% of the necessary funds) was decisive for technical profiles seeking projects where the developer risks more capital than the crowdfunding investors themselves.
