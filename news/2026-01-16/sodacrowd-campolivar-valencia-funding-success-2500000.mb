The platform SodaCrowd has successfully finalized the fundraising phase for its flagship project in the Valencian Community: Campolivar. With a final funding goal of €2,500,000 for the development of 12 single-family semi-detached homes, the operation reached its target after 89,280 minutes (62 days) of market exposure.

This fundraising pace, averaging €7 per minute, reflects a more deliberate and reflective investment dynamic, typical of projects that, despite having an excellent risk rating (A1), are launched during the administrative processing stages.

Closing Analysis: The Value of Patience in Real Estate  
Unlike the "flash" closings often seen in Madrid or Barcelona assets, Campolivar investors performed a detailed analysis of the project's fundamentals:

Total Amount Raised: €2,500,000.

Closing Time: 89,280 minutes.

Fundraising Ratio: €7 / minute.

Annual Return (TIR): 12.50%.

The project's success lies in its location. Campolivar (Godella) is one of the highest per capita income enclaves in Valencia, with a 20% appreciation in the last five years. Investors validated a proposal that combines residential luxury with the efficiency of industrialized construction, a system that drastically reduces cost overruns.

Security and Guarantees: The Bank Endorsement as a Milestone  
The support from SodaCrowd investors was built on three technical pillars:

1. Evolutionary Mortgage Guarantee The operation initially features a first-rank mortgage. The business plan anticipates the entry of bank financing in May 2027, at which point the guarantee will transition to a second-rank position. The market views this transition as a quality indicator, as it implies that a financial entity has audited and validated the technical and commercial solvency of the project.

2. Early Commercial Traction Even before closing the total financing, the project already had 40% of the homes reserved. This level of pre-sales is a decisive factor in mitigating exit risk and ensuring compliance with the estimated 12-month timeframe.

3. A1 Rating The solvency of the developer-builder, operating with a fixed budget, allowed the project to be awarded SodaCrowd's highest rating, attracting investors seeking double-digit returns (12.5%) with risk controlled by the tangibility of the asset.
