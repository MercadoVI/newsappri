Prices Cool Demand: Spain Enters a Real Estate Adjustment Phase

This article is for informational purposes only and does not, under any circumstances, constitute investment advice or a recommendation.

The Spanish residential market is beginning to show signs of cooling after nearly a decade of steady growth. According to the latest data from Spain’s National Statistics Institute (INE), housing sales registered in August reached 47,697 transactions — 3.4% fewer than in the same month of 2024 — marking the lowest August figure since the pandemic. This confirms a gradual slowdown trend that the sector had been anticipating since the beginning of the year.

The main cause is not a structural drop in demand but rather a combination of high prices, reduced access to credit, and limited new supply. While wages are growing moderately — around 3% annually, according to Eurostat — housing prices have accelerated much faster: the INE Housing Price Index (HPI) rose 12.7% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2025, the sharpest increase since 2007.

“We are in a period of adjustment, not crisis,” summarized Francisco Iñareta, spokesperson for Idealista, in statements to El País (October 23, 2025). “Demand still exists, but prices have reached a point where many buyers are temporarily stepping back from the market.”

The situation reflects a change in the cycle: transactions are slowing, but prices remain firm due to the shortage of buildable land and rising construction costs.

### A Market Stretched Between Credit and Supply

The financial environment has contributed to the slowdown. After successive rate hikes and pauses by the European Central Bank, the 12-month Euribor remains around 2.1%, still high compared to the decade-long average. This has increased the average cost of mortgages and reduced the purchasing power of first-time buyers. According to the Bank of Spain, the percentage of households able to qualify for a standard mortgage has steadily declined since 2022 — particularly among those under 40.

To this, we must add the shortage of new housing. The developers’ association APCEspaña estimates that Spain needs to build between 150,000 and 200,000 homes per year to balance the market, yet only about 85,000 are currently being built. Urban planning delays, rising material costs (+24% since 2021), and the lack of developable land in major cities explain this structural gap.

As a result, the second-hand housing market absorbs most of the demand, concentrating pressure in metropolitan and coastal areas. In Madrid, Málaga, and Valencia, the available stock is insufficient to meet effective demand, keeping prices at historically high levels despite the drop in the number of transactions.

### A Healthy Slowdown for Market Stability

Analysts agree that this moderation does not signal deterioration but rather a natural adjustment after years of accelerated expansion. The latest report by Savills Aguirre Newman highlights that Spanish housing maintains “solid and predictable behavior” compared to other European markets, where prices have experienced sharper corrections.

Foreign demand — accounting for 19% of total housing purchases, according to the General Council of Notaries — continues to act as a stabilizing factor, particularly along the Mediterranean coast and in key tourist destinations. However, even this segment shows caution: purchases by non-residents grew by just 2% year-on-year in the first half of 2025, compared to double-digit increases in previous years.

In this new environment, rental profitability is gaining importance. According to Idealista, the average gross rental yield in Spain stood at 7% in the second quarter of 2025, reflecting the strength of the rental market compared to the lower liquidity of the buyer’s market. Many small investors are now focusing on opportunities that offer stable income rather than relying solely on asset appreciation.

### Transparency and Information: Keys to the New Cycle

Spain’s market adjustment is testing both investor maturity and the quality of available information. In a context where profitability increasingly depends on active management, having comparable and up-to-date data is essential.

Until recently, individual investors had to consult multiple sources, portals, and platforms to analyze real estate projects using inconsistent metrics and limited traceability. The current trend points toward greater digitalization and standardization of information, where technology can play a central role in balancing access between large funds and retail investors.

The immediate future of the sector lies in offering investors tools that enable them to compare opportunities, understand risks, and diversify their exposure with transparency and control. This evolution will not only improve market efficiency but also strengthen confidence among those seeking to build long-term wealth rationally and sustainably.
