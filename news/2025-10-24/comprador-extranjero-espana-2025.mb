The New Geography of Foreign Buyers in Spain: The United Kingdom, Morocco, and Germany Lead Demand

This article is for informational purposes only and does not, under any circumstances, constitute investment advice or a recommendation.

The Spanish real estate market continues to attract international capital, although the profile of the foreign buyer is undergoing significant change. According to the latest data from the General Council of Notaries, during the first half of 2025 foreign nationals purchased 71,155 homes in Spain, up 2% compared to the same period the previous year. These transactions represented 19.3% of all property sales registered in the country, confirming the continued importance of international buyers in shaping the market’s dynamics.

The historical leadership of the United Kingdom remains intact. British nationals topped the ranking with 8.1% of foreign purchases, followed by Moroccans (7.9%) and Germans (6.7%). They were followed by French, Belgian, and Italian buyers, while transactions by Eastern European and Latin American nationals are showing gradual growth — though still accounting for a smaller share overall.

Unlike in the years following the pandemic, when Northern Europeans mainly acquired second homes for tourism, the current market is characterized by greater geographic and motivational diversification: wealth preservation, primary residence, and legal stability have become increasingly decisive factors.

Spain Consolidates Its Appeal as a Safe Destination

The strength of Spain’s housing market is underpinned by a combination of macroeconomic stability, legal security, and quality of life, positioning it as one of the most solid destinations in Europe for residential investment. According to José Antonio Pérez, director of the Instituto de Práctica Empresarial, quoted in El País, “Spain remains a safe haven for international investors, offering gross yields of around 6–7% in certain coastal and metropolitan areas.”

Rental returns in the most touristic provinces — such as Alicante, Málaga, and Valencia — remain among the highest in the eurozone. According to Idealista, the average gross rental yield stood at 7% in Q2 2025, slightly above the European average. This combination of recurring income and appreciation potential continues to be the main driver for foreign investors.

However, the geographical distribution of demand reveals some nuances. The Valencian Community concentrated 28% of foreign transactions, followed by Andalusia (21%) and Catalonia (13%). Madrid, traditionally favored by corporate or Latin American buyers, increased its share to 8%, consolidating its position as an emerging destination for upper-middle-class investors seeking diversification and regulatory stability within the European Union.

Changing Buyer Behavior

The international buyer is no longer limited to the traditional holiday home model. The new generation of investors — particularly from Europe and Latin America — is adopting long-term diversification strategies: acquiring income-generating rental assets, investing in renovation projects, or participating in collective operations through digital real estate investment platforms.

At the same time, the growing professionalization of individual investors is transforming how they access the market. Increasingly, buyers are using corporate structures or digital investment vehicles to manage acquisitions more efficiently and transparently. This shift reflects the maturity of a market that combines tourism appeal with a solid foundation for long-term wealth creation.

In this new context, reliable and comparable information becomes a key asset. Analyzing projects, understanding their financial structure, and accurately assessing risk are now critical steps for any investor — whether local or foreign.

Toward a More Accessible and Transparent Investment Landscape

The boom in digital real estate investment is accelerating the sector’s transformation. Spain, along with Germany, France, and the Netherlands, ranks among the European leaders in real estate crowdfunding and crowdlending growth, according to the European Crowdfunding Network (ECN). This model allows investors to participate in projects with small contributions, accessing public information on expected returns, location, and risk level.

However, the fragmentation of offerings remains one of the main challenges. Investors must navigate across multiple platforms, each with its own criteria, metrics, and information formats. The lack of standardization makes it difficult to compare opportunities and limits overall transparency.

The future of the market lies in centralizing and structuring this information, creating a unified environment where investors can access diversified opportunities, compare standardized metrics, and manage their investments from a single control interface. Value will no longer depend solely on the physical asset, but also on the quality and clarity of the data accompanying it.

Digital real estate investment is expanding rapidly across Spain and Europe. Realty Investor centralizes all real estate crowdfunding and crowdlending opportunities in a single app, allowing users to discover, compare, and invest from one unified environment with integrated registration and risk testing. The platform is committed to transparency, independence, and informational clarity, helping investors analyze projects from a unified portfolio directly on their mobile device.
