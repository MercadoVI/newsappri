Housers Launches “Valle de Arán II”: Mortgage-Backed Loan for Residential Development

This article is for informational purposes only and does not, under any circumstances, constitute investment advice or a recommendation.

The Housers real estate crowdfunding platform has activated the opportunity “Valle de Arán II”, a first-rank mortgage-backed loan aimed at financing the development of a multifamily residential building in Les (Valle de Arán, Lleida). The project is currently open for funding.

Key Project Data

Funding amount (current tranche): €325,000

Duration: 10 months (+6-month possible extension at the same 10% rate)

Nominal annual interest rate (TIN): 10%

Estimated total return: 8.33%

Interest payments: Quarterly

Repayment: At maturity (bullet)

Scoring: AA (GLOVAL)

Loan-to-Value (LTV): 34.93%

Minimum investment: €300

The project involves the construction of 9 residential units and 17 parking spaces, with an estimated construction progress of 65.12%.
Of the 9 homes, 6 are already reserved (66.67%). The total built area will reach 1,850 m², distributed across three floors (ground floor, first floor, and attic). The building permit has already been granted.

Guarantees and Real Estate Backing

The mortgage guarantee is secured by the property under development (both the homes and parking spaces).
According to a certified appraisal by Valum (August 2025), the current appraised value of the property stands at €1,932,314.69, while the estimated completed value is €2,676,466.27.

Developer: Purica Multigremio Instalaciones, Mantenimientos y Servicios, S.L. — a company with over 11 years of experience in construction and rehabilitation across the Valle de Arán region.

Opportunities

Moderate LTV (<35%) provides a safety cushion.

Competitive nominal interest rate of 10%.

Experienced local developer with a proven track record.

Advanced construction progress (>65%).

Validated demand: 6 of 9 homes already reserved.

Risks

Possible delays in completion or unforeseen technical issues.

Potential stock placement risk (sales) that could affect liquidity or returns.

Limited liquidity: exit typically occurs at maturity unless otherwise specified.

Dependence on the local market of Valle de Arán (sensitive to tourism and residential demand).

Extension risk: potential 6-month prolongation at the same rate.

Sector Analysis and Market Positioning

The Valle de Arán region combines tourism and residential appeal — proximity to Baqueira/Beret, mountain scenery, and a strong leisure offering — which sustains new housing demand.
Projects like Valle de Arán II enable investors to diversify geographically outside major urban centers, offering a moderate risk profile supported by tangible guarantees.

Tranche Structure

This €325,000 tranche forms part of a larger financing structure totaling €1,000,000, divided into multiple tranches.
All tranches share the same final maturity date: August 8, 2026.

For Realty Investor readers, Valle de Arán II represents an opportunity with a balanced risk-return profile, strong collateral, and attractive yield potential in a niche market.
