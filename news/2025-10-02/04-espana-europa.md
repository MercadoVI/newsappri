-->In 2025, Spain has consolidated itself as one of the most attractive destinations for real estate capital in Europe. Although it does not lead the ranking in absolute volume —with the United Kingdom and Germany remaining larger markets—, the dynamism of the Spanish market and its notable relative growth position the country as a reference point for institutional investors and international funds.

Data from the first half of the year are revealing. According to CBRE, in the first quarter of 2025, real estate investment reached €3.3 billion, a 39% year-on-year increase, compared with an average European growth of around 6%. In the second quarter, figures vary depending on the consulting firm: BNP Paribas Real Estate estimates €4.582 billion, while Colliers places it at €3.845 billion, for a total of €8.263 billion in the first half of the year — 44% higher than in the same period of the previous year. These discrepancies are due to different accounting criteria, but all agree on the strength of the Spanish market.

Beyond volumes, Spain’s appeal is also reflected in investment intention surveys. According to CBRE’s annual survey, Spain ranks as the second most attractive country for investment in Europe in 2025, just behind Germany. On the urban level, Madrid ranks second and Barcelona fourth, consolidating both cities as international hubs for European real estate.

### A Favorable Macroeconomic Environment

The strength of Spain’s real estate market is supported by solid macroeconomic fundamentals. In September, the OECD raised its growth forecast for Spain to 2.6% in 2025, and Moody’s upgraded the country’s credit rating to A3, reinforcing perceptions of stability. This environment, combined with a gradual easing of interest rates in the eurozone, has encouraged investors to view Spanish real assets as an attractive hedge against global volatility.

### Diversified Segments and Resilience

Investment is not limited to traditional residential assets. Segments such as rental housing, student residences, senior living, logistics, and hospitality have gained significant weight in investment portfolios. The hospitality sector, in particular, has benefited from strong international tourism and the recovery of domestic consumption.

At the same time, ESG criteria have become a sine qua non condition. Funds and insurers now prioritize energy-efficient assets and green rehabilitation projects, a factor that has significantly boosted demand for sustainable buildings in markets such as Madrid, Málaga, and Valencia.

### Structural Housing Shortage

Demand in the residential segment remains one of the key drivers of Spain’s appeal. The country’s social housing stock represents only 1.72% of households, compared with a European average of around 8%, according to the Observatorio de Vivienda y Suelo. This structural gap ensures room for growth in affordable rental projects and public-private partnerships.

Emerging cities such as Valencia, Málaga, and Bilbao, along with fast-growing metropolitan areas, are emerging as new investment hotspots. Lower entry prices compared to Madrid and Barcelona, combined with strong appreciation prospects, reinforce international funds’ interest in diversifying geographically within Spain.

### Risks to Watch

Spain’s relative leadership is not without challenges. Legal uncertainty associated with the Housing Rights Law, regulatory pressure on short-term rentals, and rising construction costs could affect transactions. Additionally, there is the risk that a resurgence in interest rates or geopolitical tensions could dampen investor appetite.

Even so, Spain’s position in 2025 is clear: in a European environment of moderate growth, the country stands out for its relative strength, urban appeal, and diversification potential across asset classes and regions.
