-->When the Spanish Government passed Law 12/2023 on the Right to Housing in May 2023, it presented the legislation as a key measure to correct imbalances in access to housing and strengthen the social function of the residential market. Two years later, the real estate sector views the law as a source of legal uncertainty and operational complexity, with a direct impact on investment decisions.

The law introduced, for the first time in Spain, a national reference index for rental prices, the possibility of declaring “stressed areas”, and a stricter framework for large property holders. In general terms, a large landlord is defined as anyone owning more than 10 urban properties, although the law allows regional governments to reduce that threshold to five properties in stressed areas. This provision has generated territorial discrepancies and a fragmented map that makes financial forecasting for operations more difficult.

A Regulation Under Dispute

The implementation of the law has been the subject of constitutional challenges. In 2024 and 2025, the Spanish Constitutional Court issued rulings (STC 79/2024 and STC 26/2025) declaring various sections of Articles 16 and 27, among others, unconstitutional, arguing that they infringed regional powers over housing and urban planning. These rulings forced the law to be amended, but they also reinforced the perception that the regulatory framework remains unsettled, increasing investor caution.

Lack of harmonization is another major obstacle. While some regions —such as Catalonia and the Basque Country— have advanced in identifying stressed areas, others have refused to apply the concept, resulting in an uneven regulatory landscape. For an international fund assessing residential projects in different Spanish cities, this fragmentation entails higher legal advisory costs and risk-analysis burdens.

Impact on the Rental Market

One of the most controversial aspects of the law is the limitation on rent updates. After two years of transitional caps —2% in 2023 and 3% in 2024—, as of 2025, contracts must be adjusted according to a new reference index developed by the INE (National Statistics Institute), which in August set a maximum update rate of 2.19%. For institutional investors, this means that the profitability of rental housing projects could fall below initial expectations, especially in areas with strong housing inflation.

At the same time, the Government has promoted the expansion of the social housing stock, but its presence in Spain remains limited — only 1.72% of households, compared with a European average of around 8%. This structural shortage keeps pressure on private rental demand high, which may conflict with the law’s ability to effectively contain prices.

Indirect Effects on Investment

Regulatory uncertainty is already visible in practice. Some developers have postponed build-to-rent projects in metropolitan areas until there is greater clarity on how local rules will be applied. Other investors, particularly international ones, have chosen to focus on less regulated segments, such as logistics, hospitality, or alternative assets (like student housing or senior living).

On the other hand, regulatory fragmentation opens the door to strategic repositioning: operators with local presence and capacity to manage legal risk may capture greater market share compared to more cautious players. Meanwhile, some individual landlords have shifted part of their portfolios toward short-term or tourist rentals, although these are also facing increasingly strict regulations in cities such as Barcelona, Valencia, and Palma.

A Balance Yet to Be Defined

The objective of Law 12/2023 —to improve access to housing— is not in dispute. However, its implementation raises a key dilemma: how to balance tenant protection with the need to attract private investment that can expand the housing supply. The perception of an unstable legal framework may limit capital inflows into the residential sector, precisely when Spain needs to expand its affordable rental housing stock to converge with European standards.

The outcome will depend on the ability of the State, regional governments, and municipalities to coordinate a coherent and predictable implementation. Until then, caution will continue to guide major investors’ decisions.
