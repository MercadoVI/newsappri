More than half of Spain’s existing homes are over 40 years old, according to cadastral data analysed by Idealista. This ageing residential stock poses a major challenge: adapting buildings to meet the European Union’s energy efficiency and sustainability targets. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Agenda estimates that around 80 percent of Spain’s properties will require some form of renovation before 2050 if the country is to meet its decarbonisation commitments. In response, two complementary strategies are gaining momentum: industrialised construction and energy-efficient rehabilitation.

Industrialised housing, based on prefabrication and off-site assembly, is gradually reshaping Spain’s construction model. According to the Building Cluster (Clúster de la Edificación), in a report published in November 2025, this method can reduce indirect costs by up to 32 percent and shorten delivery times by an average of four months compared with traditional construction. Moreover, factory-controlled processes ensure greater precision, improved quality control and significant reductions in material waste and energy consumption.

Major developers such as AEDAS Homes, Vía Célere and Acciona are spearheading this transition. AEDAS alone has completed more than 3,000 industrialised homes over the past three years, according to its corporate reports, and plans to continue increasing its share of modular construction. Although industrialised building still accounts for less than 5 percent of new housing starts, its steady annual growth points to a structural transformation within the sector.

In parallel, Spain faces the urgent need to rehabilitate its existing housing stock. The country’s average building age—around 45 years, compared with 35 in the EU—illustrates the scale of the challenge. Yet the annual renovation rate stands at just 0.1 percent, far below the 2 percent recommended by the European Commission. To accelerate progress, the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan (PRTR) has allocated €6.82 billion to energy-efficient renovation and urban regeneration programmes. However, implementation has been slow due to bureaucratic complexity and limited coordination between regional and local administrations.

Industry experts and institutions such as the General Council of Economists stress the importance of creating stable fiscal incentives to unlock private investment. Proposals include income tax deductions of up to 60 percent for energy-efficiency improvements and reduced VAT rates for certified sustainable refurbishments. Public–private partnerships are also emerging as an essential mechanism to attract capital and stimulate renovation in dense urban areas with older housing stock.

The simultaneous rise of industrialised construction and large-scale rehabilitation could redefine Spain’s real estate market. Factory-built homes offer faster delivery and cost predictability, while renovation projects extend the lifespan of existing assets, enhance neighbourhoods, and improve energy performance. Both processes can benefit from alternative financing mechanisms, such as real-estate crowdfunding, which channels retail capital into tangible projects that combine long-term returns with measurable social and environmental impact.

Spain thus faces a dual transformation: technological and sustainable. The gradual adoption of industrialised building methods and energy rehabilitation is not only an environmental imperative but also an economic opportunity. Together, they represent a pathway to modernising the sector, attracting investment, and ensuring that Spain’s housing market evolves toward a more efficient, accessible and resilient model.

Realty Investor: a project under construction
Realty Investor is developing a digital platform that will centralise all real-estate crowdfunding and crowdlending opportunities in a single environment. Its goal is to give investors the ability to discover, compare and invest in projects from one unified application, with verified information, standardised metrics and an optimised mobile experience. The project is currently under development, led by a team specialised in investment and real estate. Join the early-access list and get one month of free early access to the app.
