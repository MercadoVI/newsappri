Spain’s structural housing shortage continues to widen. Despite an increase in building permits in recent years, the supply of new homes remains insufficient to meet demand driven by demographic growth, labour mobility, and urban concentration. According to a study by OBS Business School published in August 2025 and reported by Europa Press and Forbes España, Spain will need between 1.6 and 2.3 million new homes over the next five years to stabilise the market and curb price inflation. Yet the country currently builds only about 100,000 homes per year—far short of the 240,000 annual target needed to close the gap.

The first major constraint is land availability. The Spanish Land Observatory estimates that over 70 percent of developable land is concentrated in just ten provinces. This concentration has created price pressure in the fastest-growing regions—Madrid, Barcelona, Málaga, Valencia, and Bilbao—while much of the country’s interior remains underdeveloped. Over the past two years, the average price of urban land has increased by more than 20 percent, according to data from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Agenda, driven by scarcity and high urbanisation costs.

The second challenge is bureaucratic complexity. The time required to obtain building or occupancy permits varies widely across municipalities and autonomous communities, often extending beyond a year in large cities. This inconsistency complicates project planning and increases financing costs for developers. Industry groups such as APCEspaña have called for a fully digitalised permitting system, legal deadlines for processing times, and single-window administrative procedures to reduce uncertainty. Some regions, including Madrid and Andalusia, have begun to implement partial reforms to streamline planning, though results so far have been limited.

A third structural barrier lies in taxation. The cumulative fiscal burden on residential development—including VAT, property transfer tax, municipal fees, and building licences—represents a significant share of the final home price, according to professional associations. Although there is no unified national estimate, the consensus within the sector is that the current framework discourages affordable housing. The General Council of Economists has proposed targeted reforms, such as tax deductions or temporary VAT reductions for energy-efficient renovations and affordable rental projects, to encourage private investment in high-demand segments.

The macroeconomic backdrop adds further complexity. While the OECD forecasts Spanish GDP growth of 2.6 percent in 2025, persistent core inflation and elevated interest rates continue to constrain household purchasing power. Mortgage costs remain historically high, pushing many families toward the rental market—which is already under severe strain. According to CBRE, rental supply in Spain’s major cities fell 14 percent year-on-year during the first nine months of 2025, while demand rose by 10 percent.

Experts point to three strategic levers to reverse the imbalance. First, freeing up land through better coordination between government levels and long-term metropolitan planning. Second, creating a smarter tax system that incentivises affordable housing and energy-efficient rehabilitation. And third, modernising construction through industrialisation and digitalisation, which can shorten timelines and reduce costs.

Combining these three pillars—land availability, administrative agility, and a competitive tax framework—will be essential for restoring equilibrium to the housing market. If Spain manages to tackle these issues simultaneously, it could usher in a new phase of sustainable growth, capable of meeting structural housing demand without repeating the excesses of previous cycles.
