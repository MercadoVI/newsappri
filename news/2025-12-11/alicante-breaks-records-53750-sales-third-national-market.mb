The province of Alicante has reached a historic milestone in its real estate trajectory, consolidating its status as one of Spain's most dynamic residential markets. According to data published this Thursday by the Association of Property Registrars, the province has exceeded 53,750 home sales in the last twelve months, a figure that places it as the country's third most active provincial market, trailing only Madrid and Barcelona.
This volume of transactions has been registered in a context of high generalized activity in the Spanish residential market. Alicante has shown solid performance despite the persistent high-interest rate environment, which continues to condition mortgage financing, and has benefited from a combination of particularly dynamic national and foreign demand.
Strong Presence of Foreign Buyers
The Alicante market stands out notably for the high proportion of foreign buyers. In the third quarter of 2025, more than 43% of the home sales in the province corresponded to non-Spanish buyers, a percentage that far exceeds the national average and positions Alicante as the province with the highest participation of international buyers in relative terms.
Among the nationalities with the greatest presence are citizens from the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands, as well as a diversified group of EU residents seeking housing on the Costa Blanca. The high participation of foreign buyers remains a structural factor in the provincial market, strengthening its appeal compared to other Mediterranean destinations.
Demand, Typologies, and Product Trends
The used housing market continues to account for the majority of transactions, although a significant uptick in new construction is also observed in 2025, driven by an attempt to respond to a demand that the existing stock does not fully cover with current quality and energy efficiency standards. The expansion areas of the Alicante metropolitan area and developments on the northern coast, such as Dénia and Jávea, are registering greater construction activity after years of relative inertia.
Prices and Competitive Positions
Prices in Alicante have followed an upward trajectory. Data compiled by various portals and sectoral statistics show that average square meter values reached historical highs in 2025, with consistent year-on-year increases exceeding the average of other areas on the Mediterranean arc.
This dynamism has strengthened Alicante's competitive position against other traditionally attractive destinations like the Costa del Sol or the Balearic Islands, allowing the province to capture both national and international demand that values the combination of quality of life, Mediterranean climate, and a relatively more moderate price.
Economic Impact and Structural Challenges
The high volume of sales has broader economic implications for the Valencian Community. Real estate activity contributes to regional tax collection (for example, through the Property Transfer Tax) and vitalizes housing-related sectors such as renovations, notarial services, and asset management.
Nevertheless, this success has generated pressure on the supply, especially in coastal areas, where demand from buyers with greater purchasing power tends to strain prices, posing challenges for housing accessibility for the resident population. The limited availability of affordable product continues to be a structural challenge that conditions accessibility and the balance between supply and demand.
Comparison with Other Markets
Although some European markets showed signs of deceleration in 2024 and 2025, the case of Alicante reflects a relative resilience—in terms of transaction volume and foreign demand—that contrasts with the general trend of moderation in certain European regions. This resilience is partly attributed to the high proportion of buyers who do not rely exclusively on bank financing, reducing sensitivity to the monetary policy movements of the European Central Bank.
