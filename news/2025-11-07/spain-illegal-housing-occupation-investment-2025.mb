Spain Faces the Rise of Illegal Housing Occupation: A Structural Challenge with Implications for Investment and the Real Estate Market

This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute, under any circumstances, investment advice or a recommendation.

The phenomenon of illegal housing occupation has once again become a central issue in Spain’s social and economic debate. According to the latest data from the Ministry of the Interior, 16,426 criminal offences related to housing occupation—including both unlawful entry and squatting—were recorded in 2024, representing a 7% increase compared to 2022. Although this figure represents only 0.06% of Spain’s total housing stock (more than 26 million homes, according to the National Statistics Institute, INE), the territorial concentration and slow judicial processes have turned the issue into a structural challenge with tangible effects on real estate investment.

Catalonia at the epicenter

The geographical distribution of occupation cases shows a clear concentration: Catalonia accounts for 42% of all incidents, with more than 7,000 reports in 2024, followed by Andalusia and the Valencian Community, according to data from the Ministry itself. In regions such as Catalonia and Madrid, the problem primarily affects vacant homes, commercial premises converted into dwellings, and developments awaiting sale.

Experts point to multiple causes: a chronic shortage of affordable housing, a high concentration of vacant properties in certain urban areas, and a slow, complex judicial system. At the same time, the lack of social housing and the difficulties accessing rental accommodation have exacerbated social tensions.

Impact on investment and the real estate market

While the number of occupied homes remains relatively low, the economic and reputational impact is significant. Institutional and private investors now view squatting risk as an important factor in asset valuation—especially in metropolitan areas with higher incidence rates. This perception influences required returns and can reduce investment appetite in certain residential segments.

The Spanish Association of Rental Housing Owners (Asval) warns that perceived legal uncertainty has led many property owners to withdraw homes from the rental market or raise rents to offset risk. This trend further deepens the imbalance between supply and demand: the Ministry of Housing estimates that Spain will need over three million rental homes in the next fifteen years to meet structural demand.

For the investment market, this translates into a growing risk premium for residential projects located in areas with higher conflict levels. Real estate funds and crowdfunding platforms are increasingly incorporating specific territorial risk assessments and occupation insurance policies as part of their due diligence and monitoring procedures.

A legal framework with room for improvement

Spanish law distinguishes between two offences: unlawful entry into a residence, which protects occupied dwellings and carries prison sentences of six months to two years, and usurpation of real estate, which applies to vacant properties and is punishable by fines or imprisonment of up to one year. The latter typically involves lengthy judicial procedures, often taking several months before the property is restored to the owner.

The government has announced plans to streamline eviction procedures and improve coordination between courts and law enforcement, aiming to shorten recovery times for property owners. However, the political debate remains polarized between those advocating for stricter penalties and those calling for a social approach focused on housing access and the prevention of exclusion.

At the same time, courts and regional prosecutors apply differing interpretations regarding “residence” and “legitimate possession,” creating legal uncertainty and reinforcing the perception of vulnerability among property owners. Legal associations and real estate groups have called for the creation of a specific civil fast-track procedure to handle cases not linked to proven social vulnerability.

Alternative financing and market professionalization

The rise of real estate crowdfunding, which according to the Spanish Crowdfunding Association exceeded €250 million in 2024, has introduced new tools for managing these risks. Platforms have begun offering insurance coverage for non-payment and illegal occupation, as well as real-time asset monitoring during project execution. These mechanisms are helping to strengthen investor confidence and enhance transparency across the sector.

Insurance companies have also expanded their range of specialized occupation policies, covering lost rental income and legal expenses for eviction proceedings. Such instruments mitigate financial exposure and facilitate asset recovery in the event of occupation.

A structural challenge tied to Spain’s housing deficit

Beyond the legal and security dimensions, the occupation issue reveals a deeper structural imbalance in housing accessibility. Spain has one of the smallest public housing stocks in the European Union, with just 2.5% of total homes dedicated to social rent—compared with 17% in France and 23% in the Netherlands, according to Eurostat. The lack of public housing alternatives and slow urban planning processes have compounded pressure on urban markets.

Addressing the problem requires a dual strategy: ensuring effective legal protection of property rights while expanding public housing programs and urban regeneration initiatives. A stable and predictable framework is crucial for maintaining investor confidence and channeling capital toward sustainable and affordable housing projects.

Spain thus faces a dual challenge: strengthening legal certainty while expanding access to affordable homes. The way it balances these priorities will shape the long-term outlook of its real estate market and its ability to continue attracting investment in an environment of social and economic uncertainty.
