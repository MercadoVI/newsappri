The latest data published by idealista on 18 November 2025 reveals an increasingly polarised Spanish property market: major capitals with very strong buyer competition on one side, and high-end residential enclaves where the average price comfortably exceeds one million euros on the other. Although both dynamics coexist within the national landscape, they respond to different forces and must be analysed separately to understand the market’s evolution.

In urban areas, seven provincial capitals lead the national ranking in demand pressure for home purchases: Madrid, Zaragoza and Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the top positions, followed by Valencia, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Barcelona and Seville. The ranking is based on the ratio of interested buyers to available listings, a metric that illustrates how competitive each local market has become. Despite their elevated price levels, none of these capitals reaches an average value close to one million euros; however, they concentrate a significant share of buyer activity and remain central to Spain’s residential market dynamics.

At the same time, idealista identifies nine municipalities—none of them provincial capitals—where the average home price exceeds one million euros: Benahavís, Santa Eulalia del Río, Calvià, Marbella, Sotogrande, Benissa, Moraira, Benitachell and Altea. These markets are defined by a combination of scarce supply, strong international demand and limited room for urban expansion, conditions that sustain their position within the country’s top luxury segment. Although these locations do not necessarily top the ranking in demand pressure, they constitute the most expensive residential markets in Spain.

The coexistence of these two segments highlights a duality within the property landscape: capitals that combine economic activity, employment, mobility and strong domestic demand, and high-end coastal enclaves driven primarily by international appeal, natural environment and constrained supply. Both segments show resilience, but for fundamentally different reasons, and their price trends do not necessarily move in parallel.

Idealista also notes that within the most in-demand capitals, average listing prices exceed €600,000 in Madrid and approach €460,000 in Barcelona. These levels reinforce demand pressure despite being far below the million-euro threshold seen in exclusive coastal markets. The gap underscores the ongoing challenges of affordability for many buyers and helps explain the rising interest in peripheral or more affordable urban areas.

Overall, the Spanish residential market is shaping into a landscape of pronounced contrasts: major capitals with structurally robust demand and select enclaves where property has consolidated as an ultra-premium asset. The interaction between these segments underscores the growing importance of local dynamics, urban quality, labour markets and international buyer flows in defining the country’s real estate outlook.
