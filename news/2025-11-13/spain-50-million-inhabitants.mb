Spain reached a historic population high as of October 1, 2025: 49,442,844 residents, according to the National Statistics Institute (INE). This represents an increase of 105,488 people during the third quarter and 474,454 year-on-year, marking the highest figure ever recorded. The growth stems almost entirely from the foreign-born population, which now totals 9.83 million, while the native-born population continues to decline. Residents holding foreign nationality number 7.13 million, also a record. For the real estate market, this demographic surge establishes a new “baseline” of structural demand that contrasts with a housing supply still constrained in key urban areas.

The most relevant indicator for housing demand is not the number of inhabitants but the number of households, which reflects the real formation of housing needs. At the end of the third quarter, Spain reached 19,684,380 households, up by 55,109 in just three months. Each new household effectively translates into new housing demand, at a time when supply is lagging due to lengthy construction timelines and material bottlenecks. This imbalance is particularly acute in large cities, where many newly formed households enter the rental market before moving to ownership —a dynamic that continues to drive upward pressure on rents despite existing regulations.

The geographic distribution of population growth also matters. Valencia (+0.40%), Aragon (+0.36%), and Castilla-La Mancha (+0.34%) recorded the largest quarterly increases, but all regions experienced population gains. For developers and investors, this trend reinforces two insights: the consolidation of emerging urban and peri-urban markets where prices remain below Madrid and Barcelona levels, and the growing need to diversify product types —affordable new-build housing, suburban developments, and energy-efficient renovations— supported by adequate infrastructure and services capable of attracting stable, long-term residents.

The migratory component of this growth —driven mainly by arrivals from Colombia, Spain (returning nationals), and Morocco— also shapes market behavior. Different household sizes and employment profiles influence the type of housing demanded, from flexible rentals and regulated coliving to family-oriented homes in well-connected suburbs. With limited available land and slow permitting, rehabilitation emerges as a key strategy: unlocking existing stock through renovation can bring more units to market faster than new construction.

For institutional and retail investors alike, the takeaway is twofold. In the short term, rising household formation underpins resilience in residential rental yields, hospitality assets, and neighborhood retail. In the medium term, the demographic peak raises the structural “floor” of demand for housing, requiring long-term planning around land development, affordable stock, and industrialized construction. The issue is no longer whether demand exists —it clearly does— but where and with what type of product it can be delivered efficiently and affordably. The INE’s data provide the map; execution capacity and regulatory speed will determine whether this demographic momentum translates into tangible housing supply.
