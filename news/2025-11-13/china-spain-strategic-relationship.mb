King Felipe VI’s state visit to China —the first by a Spanish monarch in eighteen years— has placed renewed emphasis on the economic dimension of the bilateral relationship. In Beijing, the King and President Xi Jinping highlighted their “solid ties” and announced a package of ten cooperation agreements, including a memorandum to create a joint commission aimed at facilitating Spanish companies’ access to the Chinese market. The diplomatic gesture and the accompanying technical instruments reopen a dialogue channel that Spain hopes to translate into greater trade and investment flows. For Spanish real estate, the message is clear: the Sino-Spanish agenda is once again operational at a moment when the sector seeks stable demand and patient capital.

The real estate implications are far from secondary. Stronger flows between both countries directly impact tourism, retail, and logistics —three pillars closely tied to property assets. In 2024, Spain received 647,801 Chinese tourists, a 66.7 % year-on-year increase and about 92.5 % of pre-pandemic levels, according to Turespaña. The trend continued upward in 2025. These travelers, whose average spending exceeds that of most European visitors, concentrate in premium urban destinations, supporting demand for high-end hotels, prime retail, and regulated tourist apartments. This dynamic also underpins the investment rationale for hotel renovations and repositioning of retail premises in top-tier locations.

The renewed diplomatic framework comes amid a structural trade imbalance: in 2024, Spain exported goods worth €7.47 billion to China while importing €45.17 billion, resulting in a coverage ratio of 16.5 %, according to the Spanish Ministry of Industry and Trade. This asymmetry forces Spain to craft a selective “strategic openness” narrative —seeking inbound investment while safeguarding sensitive sectors. In real estate, that translates into two likely trends: potential interest from Chinese groups in hospitality, retail management, and logistics tied to e-commerce, where Spain still faces structural supply shortages; and tighter regulatory scrutiny. As EU-China economic coordination strengthens, any large-scale entry of Chinese capital will need to comply with European standards on governance and transparency—an area where Spanish REITs (SOCIMI) and investment platforms have already made significant progress in recent years.

The practical value of the agreements signed in Beijing will depend on their implementation. The package includes measures to facilitate trade and regulatory cooperation that could speed up private investment missions and indirectly boost hotel occupancy, commercial leases, and warehouse absorption. China’s stated commitment to “deepening cooperation” and the business-focused Spanish delegation suggest that the coming months will see working groups and technical forums where real estate projects may position themselves to attract financial or operational partners.

For developers and asset managers, the roadmap is to monitor the evolution of air connectivity and visa policy —key for Asian tourism—, track demand shifts in urban centers with high international exposure, and explore partnerships with Chinese operators in fields where they bring competitive advantages, such as hospitality management, data-driven retail, or cross-border logistics. Yet normalization of relations does not remove risk: the EU remains cautious over trade imbalances and strategic dependencies, and any regulatory friction could feed into project costs or timelines. The opportunity is tangible but requires prudent execution, robust contracts, and sensitivity analyses that factor in potential policy or travel-cycle changes.
